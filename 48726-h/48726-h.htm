<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HIS story is an attempt to make known the
men and women who once lived and loved
and suffered amid these very scenes wherein we are
now enacting our own life stories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In dealing with historical events and characters it
seems only fair to the reader to avow what liberties
have been taken with facts, and to state exactly to
what extent this tale is founded upon history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Le Ber family were prominent figures among
their contemporaries. Jacques Le Ber, brother-in-law
to the redoubtable Charles Le Moyne, was one of the
richest merchants of New France. A hardy and
intrepid soldier, he was ennobled by Louis XIV.
in 1696. In speaking of him M. Dollier de Casson
says: “M. Jacques Le Ber has in this way rendered
valuable services to the colony, exposing himself
very often in canoe, on the ice, or in the woods,
carrying despatches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His only daughter, Jeanne Le Ber, was considered
a great heiress. At seventeen she determined to offer
herself as an expiatory offering for the sins of her
country. During the fifteen years following she
remained in seclusion in her father’s house, and was
never seen but once, and that exactly as described
in this story. Later, this fair enthusiast decided to
give the Sisters of the Congregation sufficient money
to build their church, if they would provide her a
cell behind the altar in which she could spend the
remainder of her days. This cell, divided into three
storeys, and extending the whole length of the building,
was from ten to twelve feet deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The original deed, containing these conditions—drawn
up by Bassett, a notary of Ville Marie, and
signed by the principal nuns of the Congregation,
as well as by M. Dollier de Casson, Superior of the
Seminary—may still be seen in the Registrar’s office
in Montreal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Le Ber family proved substantial benefactors
to the Sisters of the Congregation. Pierre Le Ber
the eldest son, left them a legacy of two thousand
francs, and his sister remembered them handsomely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pierre Le Ber joined Charon de la Barre in founding
L’Institut des Frères Hospitaliers de Ville
Marie. He was the only one of Charon’s associates
who remained faithful to the end. He appears to
have been the first Canadian artist, and painted portraits
of le Sieur Bourgeois, St. Paul, Ste. Therèse,
and the Virgin Mary, for different churches. He died
in 1707, and his heart was buried in the Church of
the Congregation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia Longloy, a New England girl, was taken
prisoner by the Abenaquis in 1694. She was baptized
a Roman Catholic in Ville Marie on April 14th,
1696.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chevalier de Crisasi was a veritable personage.
Charlevoix says of this gentleman: “One does
not know which to admire most, his skill in war,
his sagacity in council, his fertility of resource, or
his presence of mind in action.” The elder brother,
the Marquis de Crisasi, was appointed Governor of
Three Rivers; the Chevalier, neglected by his friends
and forgotten by the Court, died of a broken heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame de Monesthrol, her niece, and Nanon can
lay no claim to be considered historical, but have
been drawn after close and extensive study of the
types portrayed in the histories and memoirs of the
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be objected that the expedition of Diane
and Lydia to Mount Royal is improbable; but it
must be remembered the road to the Mountain furnished
the most popular pilgrimage of that period,
and the dangers which beset the enterprise only
heightened its merits. At a still earlier date
Madame d’Aillebout and her sister climbed the
mountain-side nine days in succession in order to
make a neuvena before the cross erected by Maisonneuve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four Iroquois were actually burned at Montreal
in the manner described, but the event occurred in
1701. Dubocq’s exploit is likewise historically correct,
but it also occurred some years later than I have
taken the liberty of placing it. In these, as in some
other instances, the actual chronology has not been
strictly followed, but has been altered to suit the
exigencies of the tale.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>A</span> LANGUID summer day was that of the 3rd of
August, 1690. A light mist lay like a veil
upon the St. Lawrence, spreading out in grand and
generous swell, the Lake of Two Mountains glimmering
in the distance like a silver shield. The eye
lingered on noble heights, sunny slopes and deep
forest glooms. Near the shore grasses leaned over
the surface of the stream, rushes tall and straight
waved with the ripples, but from their tangled and
interlacing fibres the water flowed clear. The St.
Lawrence was full of tinkling tremors of sound. The
distant hills showed blue and vague through the
fluctuating haze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Seigniory of de Senneville this was a busy
time. The Seignior, Jacques Le Ber, had been superintending
the gathering of his harvests. A far-sighted
and thrifty man in business affairs, while
the whole colony existed in a state of extreme
penury he had contrived to accumulate great wealth.
To him the New World had proved wonderfully
profitable. The Western fur trade had led to fortune.
Indomitable energy and sound judgment aided him
to overcome the difficulties under which the new
country labored, while experience, joined to natural
shrewdness, taught how to steer safely between the
varying official interests which in turn directed the
colony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ravages of the caterpillars had left little harvest
to gather, and had it not been for the marvellous
incursion of squirrels, which fairly swarmed over the
land, many of the people must have starved. Broken,
uneven fields stretched to the borders of the forest.
Amidst the stumps and prostrate trees of the unsightly
clearing, the colonists pursued their labors,
protected by a body of regulars whom the merchants
had brought from Ville Marie. At short distances
sentinels were posted to give the alarm at any sign of
approaching danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These were troublous times for the handful of
French settlers scattered amidst the savage hordes
and half-reclaimed forests of the New World. Amid
tangled thickets and deep ravines, in the shade and
stillness of columned woods, behind woody islets,
everywhere there lurked danger and terror. The
fierce and cruel Iroquois were on the war-path. These
tireless savages owed their triumphs as much to craft
as to their extraordinary boldness and bravery. They
rarely approached the settlements in winter, when the
trees and bushes had no leaves to conceal their
advance, and when their movements would be
betrayed by the track of their snowshoes, but they
were always to be expected at the time of sowing
and harvest, when it was possible to do the most
mischief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely one of the little party collected at Senneville
but had passed through scenes of grim horror.
Though they chattered over their work with true
Gallic light-heartedness and vivacity, most of them
could have related experiences of the unsleeping
hatred and cruelty of the Iroquois and the hardships
of forest life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only two years before, Louison Guimond’s young
brother had been butchered before her eyes, and with
the remains of the mutilated body the dazed and
miserable woman had journeyed alone through the
wilderness to secure Christian burial for her dead.
Sans Quartier, an old soldier, returning from an
expedition, had found his home in ashes and his
young wife and child carried away captive. Another
soldier, Frap d’Abord, held his musket awkwardly
(though none could do better service) because his
finger had been burned in the bowl of an Indian pipe,
one of the many ingenious forms of torture practised
by the Iroquois. Baptiste Bras de Fer, a hardy
Canadian voyageur and coureur de bois, could tell
true tales of peril and adventure in the pathless
forest, such as chilled the blood in the listener’s
veins—stories of forced marches through sodden
snowdrifts and matted thickets, over rocks and cliffs
and swollen streams, when men, perishing from cold
and famine, boiled moccasins for food, and scraped
away the snow in search of beech and hickory nuts.
The resignation born of long usage, the conviction
that these conditions were beyond remedy, that the
only thing to be done was to endure, enabled these
people to assume a demeanor of calmness and
patience. But there was always an hysterical quiver
in Louison’s shrill laughter. When Sans Quartier
was silent the lines of pain deepened in his stern,
bronzed face; the very name of an Indian was sufficient
to make Frap d’Abord swear long strings of
queer, quaint oaths. Nevertheless their chatter usually
flowed on cheerily, with much merriment and little
complaint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scanty harvests had been gathered, and the
party, with the exception of Gregoire and his wife,
Goulet the farmer, and the soldiers left to garrison
the fort, prepared for their return to Ville Marie.
Though the distance to be traversed was not great,
the journey was both toilsome and perilous. In
order to escape the turmoil of the Lachine Rapids
the canoes had to be shouldered through the forest.
The large flat-bottomed boats, being too heavy for
such handling, were to be dragged and pushed in the
shallow water close to the bank by gangs of men,
who toiled and struggled amidst rocks and foam.
Just now the danger and inconvenience of transit
were considerably increased by the presence of some
of the ladies of the Le Ber household who had
accompanied the party to Senneville.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shrewd trader and fearless soldier as was the honest
merchant of Ville Marie, he possessed a knightly
spirit and had never yet been able to refuse a request
urged by his ward, Diane de Monesthrol. When that
capricious damsel had determined to accompany the
harvesting expedition, and had persuaded Le Ber’s
nephew, Le Moyne de St. Helène, and his young wife
(who as Jeanne de Fresnoy Carion had also been Le
Ber’s ward,) to join it, it was perfectly understood in
the household that opposition was useless, and the
merchant, against his better judgment, yielded to the
girl’s pretty coaxing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Throw your tongue to the dogs—of what use to
argue with our demoiselle; she has always ten
answers to one objection. One fine day she, and
we others tied to her heels, will furnish an excellent
meal to those sorcerers of Iroquois—faith of Nanon
Benest!” cried Madame de Monesthrol’s serving-woman,
with the freedom of a faithful and attached
French servant.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Jacques Le Ber stood close to the shore, where the
men, shouting and joking, were loading the boats.
His was a round, bourgeois, somewhat heavy type of
face, seamed and tanned by work and weather, decorated
by a slight moustache, and redeemed from
commonness by bright, earnest eyes. He wore a
three-cornered hat, and over his ample shoulders
was spread a stiff white collar of wide expanse and
studied plainness. He looked what he was, a well-to-do
citizen of good renown and sage deportment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Diane de Monesthrol’s approach he turned
hastily. A true and earnest friendship united the
busy trader and this young girl of noble birth. No
young cavalier (and Diane was said to be the fairest
demoiselle in New France) appreciated the fairness of
her gracious youth more thoroughly than the world-worn
elderly man whose thoughts were engrossed with
so many pressing material interests. His most soothing
consolations for several years past had come from
this eager-eyed, girlish creature who seemed intuitively
to comprehend his feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of his prosperity the merchant had
experienced heavy bereavements. He had lost his
wife, the thoughtful and sympathetic partner of all his
interests. When their only daughter in the early
promise of her youth had resolved to withdraw into
absolute seclusion, and devote herself as a public
offering to God for the sins of her country, spiritual
pride had induced him to consent to the sacrifice.
He had been assured by his guides in religion that
he and his wife were to serve as models to all the
parents in the colony; they would be honored as
was Abraham for his sacrifice of Isaac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, even with that consolation, the sundering of
domestic ties lay heavily on his heart. In the sober
wisdom that came with years of disappointment,
through the dark experiences that usually isolate
men’s thoughts, he had found comfort in the frank,
simple, and guileless spirit of the girl to whom he had
afforded protection. In reality the man had two
natures: the one practical, ambitious, worldly, which
was known to all the world; the other, rarely suspected,
was ideal and passionate, and throve apart
from all the common requirements of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The primeval strength and freshness of a new
world, as yet uncontaminated by the vices of advanced
civilization, seemed to have breathed into this girl an
abounding energy which resulted in a rare union of
vigor and native delicacy. The transplanted flower
had not lost the charm distinctive of her class, and
had gained in spirit and character. The warmth of
the sunlight, the flush of youth, the fresh breeze of the
springtide had crystallized within her. The glory of
this undiscovered country, full of grand perils and
deliverances, storms to be braved, griefs, joys and
labors to be lived through, were in the highest degree
congenial to her dauntless temperament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they made ready to start, Le Ber’s eyes rested
with satisfied gaze upon the radiant beauty of his
young ward. Her complexion was purely pale; the
delicately-cut features, lit up by that undisturbed
equanimity which is the inheritance of vigorous minds,
were piquant rather than regular. The cheeks were
beautified by playful dimples, the short upper lip was
fresh as a rose, while the softly-rounded and mutinous
chin indicated reserve forces of strength as yet scarcely
suspected. Madame de Monesthrol sometimes lamented
that according to the canons of taste her niece’s
eyes ought to have been brown, yet in defiance of all
rule they were intensely blue, and shaded by black
heavy curling lashes. Her hair, lightly powdered, was
partly crimped and partly curled. Her gown of dark
cloth opened at the throat, which was veiled by a lace
kerchief; a long waisted corsage fitted tightly over
the bust, and flounces of lace finished off the under-skirt
and fell from the sleeves. The regard which
Diane turned on the world was the frank, friendly
and confiding look of a child; mischievous often it
might be, scornful sometimes at the sight of anything
mean or paltry, yet always the simple gaze of a soul
as yet undisturbed by passion or distrust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it has been pleasant to have me with you?”
the girl asked, taking her guardian’s arm, and looking
up smilingly into his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wrinkles under Le Ber’s deep-set eyes and the
tense lines about his mouth relaxed in an indulgent
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That goes without saying, my little one; your
presence carries sunshine. We must remember, however,
the nerves of Madame la Marquise, who will
doubtless await your return with anxiety. If we
would reach Ville Marie by daylight it is time to
start; and not to succeed in doing so would expose
us to many dangers. Nanon has at last completed
her preparations. St. Helène is anxious to be gone;
experience has taught him the perils of delay. Nor
shall I feel at rest until I see you within the walls of
the town.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>“I</span> SHOULD like the Indians to know that we
understand the use of the paddle! I don’t
absolutely deny that these savages possess some skill
in constructing a canoe; but, I ask you, have they
the address to give it the daintiness of form which
renders ours so coquettish as they dance upon the
water? This is not a canoe—it is a feather—a bird
that skims the air—a cloud chased by the wind—it
should fly! You may see what marvels of swiftness
that of M. du Chesne will perform directly.” So
spoke a tall Canadian, whose skill as a boatman had
gained him the title of “le Canotier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame de St. Helène stood cloaked and hooded
in black lace, an elegant, dignified figure whose
appearance savored too much of the refinement of
urban life to be in harmony with this rustic scene.
Her two little children, attended by servants, were
beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would we were safe within the shelter of Ville
Marie,” she said wistfully. “Once we quit the stone
walls of the fort who can say what trouble may
assail us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! for that, trouble comes soon enough; it is
not worth our while to search for it, Jeanne,” her
husband returned lightly. “The question now to be
considered is our immediate start. Why, I wonder,
do we linger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The canoes were ready. Soldiers and workmen
gathered around them looking expectantly toward
the fort. Among these a woman pushed her way,
scolding, laughing, gesticulating. Nanon was a
comely woman of her class, strong and thick-set,
with a face full of piquancy and vivacity. Brown as
a berry was this daughter of southern France, with
red cheeks and eyes black as sloes. She wore a
brown petticoat, a crimson apron with a bib, and a
coquettish lace cap with hanging lappets. At every
vehement movement her long gold earrings quivered
and jingled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold! Madame, Mademoiselle and these gentlemen
all are accommodated, and I but attend the good
pleasure of the Sieur du Chesne,” she protested in
high, shrill tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh, corbleu! but no, this good Nanon awaits no
convenience of mine,” remonstrated a laughing boyish
voice; “there is place in the craft of Sans Quartier
for thee, my girl. Diane has promised to share my
canoe, father,” turning to Le Ber, who stood by an
amused listener, “and I have no hesitation in wagering
that it is we who shall reach Lachine first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hein, no!” Nanon reduced her forehead to an
inch of tight cords, crossed her arms, and shook
herself from side to side in the most approved style
of obstinacy. “I have morals, me, even in the wilderness.
It is necessary to remember <span class='it'>les convenances</span>.
In our country ladies are guarded under the care of
their mothers, as the hen gathers her chickens under
her wings. My demoiselle has been confided to my
care by Madame la Marquise; not a step, not a
shadow of a step, moves my young lady without my
attendance. Madame counts upon my faith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I who am responsible to Madame la Marquise
for Mademoiselle de Monesthrol; nor is it
likely that surrounded by friends any harm will befall
her. Your faithful attachment to your mistress, my
girl, alone excuses the presumption of your interference.
Du Chesne, you will take charge of Diane;
Jean and Nanon will follow closely in the larger
canoe; we shall all remain in sight of one another.”
Thus Le Ber decisively settled the question; then,
holding his hat under his arm, with a profound bow
he offered his hand to conduct Madame de St. Helène
to the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, are you satisfied?” the young man laughed
gaily. “Diane, is it not a joke? You and I surely
might be allowed to take care of ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nanon was still disposed to be nettled; she
resented Le Ber’s rebuke, but no one could ever
resist the gay confidence of the trader’s youngest son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean Le Ber du Chesne might fitly serve as an
example of the best type of the colonial youth of the
period. Born and nurtured in Canada, thoroughly
versed in woodcraft, seasoned to toil, fatigue and
trying extremes of climate, trained amidst dangers
and alarms, while yet in his teens he had acquired a
reputation for tact and courage. As the sea is the
sailor’s native element, his cherished career, his passion,
so was the forest that of Le Ber du Chesne.
From childhood he had accompanied his cousins, the
Le Moynes, a family of heroes, upon the most difficult
and arduous expeditions. In the elastic buoyancy
of early youth, hardship and perils had but
developed an uncommon vitality and afforded opportunities
for the display of resource and valor. The
austerity of the most sombre acetic relaxed at the
sight of his debonair face; the craftiest of Indian
diplomats, the most lawless of coureurs de bois were
alike moulded to the purposes of the young Canadian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall keep Bibelot with us. Diane and I
have no desire to furnish <span class='it'>bouillon à l’Iroquois</span>; we
should neither of us relish being thrown into the
kettle.” Du Chesne’s gay inadvertent laugh rang
out as he jested with one of the grimmest terrors of
colonial life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three soldiers rowed the larger craft, occupied by
Le Ber and St. Helène with the wife and children
of the latter. Several other boats followed, carrying
servants, soldiers, workpeople and baggage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hasten, then, my son; follow us closely.” Le
Ber looked around anxiously. “It is but three years,
remember, since Senneville was last attacked by the
Iroquois. What has been may happen again. It is
the policy of the savages to attack stragglers. Above
all things it is necessary to keep together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The oars were raised high in the air, and as they
moved a shower of crystal drops flashed in the sunlight.
At the same time the voices of the boatmen
broke out into a lusty chorus which rang cheerily
across the water:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;“Y’a-t il un étang.</p>
<p class='line0'>Fringue, Fringue sur l’aviron.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Trois beaux canards</p>
<p class='line0'>S’en vont baignants</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Fringue, Fringue sur la rivière</p>
<p class='line0'>Fringue, Fringue sur l’aviron.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Du Chesne was holding the canoe into which
Diane was about to step when there arose an outcry
from the fort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur! Monsieur! Sieur du Chesne!” It was
Nanon, her plump figure quivering with excitement,
who called in hot haste. “It is that snake of a
Gouillon who disputes with the soldiers. Hasten,
then, ere there is murder done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But an instant, Diane. That lazy varlet lives but
to do mischief—just when we are in haste, too. But
he shall pay for his pleasure this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane remained alone upon the shore, watching the
rapidly disappearing party, gaily waving a bright-hued
silken scarf as long as they were in sight.
Gentle fancies, floating vaguely through her mind
without ever assuming definite form, were reflected on
her face in lines of exquisite sweetness; her delicately
fanciful maiden dreams inspired no yearning for
future bliss, but only perfect satisfaction with the
present. The voyage down the river would be one
continuous pleasure. She and the young man were
close comrades and firm friends. Being very young
when his mother died, the affectionate lad had
grieved deeply. In his loneliness it was his young
playmate who had come nearest to his heart; she had
taken the place of the sister whom religious enthusiasm
had estranged from all human interests.
Diane had become his warmest sympathizer, the
confidante of countless escapades. The girl, on her
part, was conscious that the serenity of the blue sky,
the tender greenness and stillness of the landscape,
all seemed to borrow a new charm when viewed in
his company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Seigniory had once been called Boisbriant,
after the first grantee, Sidrac de Gui, Sieur de Briant,
but when it passed into Le Ber’s possession, it was
renamed Senneville. It was a post of considerable
strategic value. The fort, built at the end of the
Island of Montreal, where the St. Lawrence and
Ottawa Rivers joined, offered effectual protection
against the attacks of the Iroquois, and was of great
service to the colony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In front the Ottawa flowed, through its picturesque
and fertile islands, while on the other side the St.
Lawrence rolled like a river of gold. A little to the
north-west the water expanded into the Lake of Two
Mountains, the twin peaks which gave it their name
appearing in the hazy distance. On Ile St. Paul Le
Ber had erected large storehouses. On Ile Perrot
stood a cluster of buildings constructed by Le Ber’s
rival and antagonist, Perrot, the ex-Governor of Ville
Marie, in order to intercept the Indian tribes from the
upper lakes on their way to the annual fair at Montreal.
Ile Perrot was the rendezvous of soldiers who
had escaped from the restraints of a harsh discipline
to the freedom of the woods, and of rovers of every
description outlawed by the royal edict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fort at Senneville was remarkably well built;
the material of rough boulder stones, with stone jambs,
lintel sills and fire-places. The buildings formed a
parallelogram of which the residence was one end, the
sides being simply defensive walls, nowhere more than
twelve feet high, pierced with loopholes and having a
gateway. At the angles stood flanking towers, the
first two being connected with a wall which did not
come much above the first floor window. The courtyard
was nearly square, measuring about eighty feet
each way, and looking north-west across the Lake of
Two Mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The residential part had a frontage of about eighty
feet and a depth of thirty-five. In front it was two
stories in height, but, as the ground was higher inside
the courtyard, at the back it was only a story and a
half. It had a high pitched roof, tall chimneys and
wide fire-places. The walls of the towers were
strengthened by an outward spread at the base. The
towers measured only about twelve feet square inside;
they were two and a half stories in height and had
large windows in their outer walls, and on the sides,
commanding the main walls, small embrasures were
mounted with light artillery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to the castle proper there were out-buildings
which served more than one purpose. A
few hundred yards back from the river the ground
swelled to a gently wooded height, crowned by a
fortified windmill. These picturesque structures were
a distinctive feature in the landscape throughout all
New France and did good service in protecting the
settlers. The mill at Senneville possessed rather an
unusual adjunct, a hooded door which served the
same purpose as the machicolations of a mediæval
castle. The tower was three stories in height, and
measured fifteen feet inside, the floor being supported
by strong oak beams. The chimney was simply a
flue in the thickness of the wall opening to the outer
air just below the second story ceiling; the hood
opened before the floor of the same chamber. The
roof was of conical form, covered with shingles, the
latter always a point of weakness in time of attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nature here on every side unfolded panoramic
views of loveliness. Flickers of light were reflected
in the water; trailing vines festooned the trees.
There were quiet marshes golden with swaying
grasses, and, farther away, sombre masses of pine
through which opened mysterious shadowy vistas.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>D</span>ESPITE the beauty of the scene just described,
Bibelot, the dog, was plainly dissatisfied with
the existing order of things. She was a direct
descendant of Pilot, one of a number of dogs sent
from France to Ville Marie shortly after its foundation
in order to assist the brave colonists in their
warfare against the Indians. Detesting the savages
by instinct, these trusty animals were invaluable in
detecting ambuscades. Bibelot now ran here and
there, her bushy tail raised high and curled like a
feather over her back, her slender, alert head and
bright eyes full of keen interest, sniffing among the
grass and branches as though solicitous of some trail
of fox or rabbit. Game abounded in the woods;
from where she stood Diane could see a great herd of
elk defile quietly between the water and the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dog’s persistent uneasiness attracted Diane’s
attention. Suddenly the long-drawn, melancholy cry
of a water-fowl fell upon her ear. The sound might
have passed unheeded by faculties less keen and
highly strung; but as she started at the cry, Bibelot,
throwing back her head and quivering all over with
rage, uttered a low, deep growl. The call was repeated
several times. Could it be a signal? The dog’s
excitement seemed to warrant the supposition. As
she gazed apprehensively about her, the trunk of
a fallen tree, lying on the ground close at hand,
seemed to Diane to stir. Was imagination playing her
false? The girl had grown up amidst the constant
dangers of the adventurous colonial life. She knew
well that the Iroquois roamed through the deserted
settlements and prowled continually around the forts.
No one could account for the mysterious movements
of these agile warriors, nor for the subtlety and malice
of their stratagems. She now stood perfectly still as
if she were a figure painted on the pale green background.
The heart beat high in her breast, the
color came and went in her cheek. A gray squirrel
with small bright eyes scudded through the grass
close beside her. At that instant the log moved
again, this time with a hasty, impulsive jerk. There
was no doubt but that in the hollow trunk an Indian
lay concealed. Immediately the loud clamor of
Bibelot’s bark rang out, clear and distinct. Quick
as a gleam of light the forest was alive with shadowy
figures moving stealthily and silently among the
trees. Diane saw that her only chance of escape
lay in immediate action, and that the lives of those in
the fort might depend upon her presence of mind.
She understood but too well the nameless horrors
which captivity among the savages meant—death
was nothing in comparison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Aux armes! aux armes!</span>” the girlish voice rang
out in clear, piercing tones. Bibelot’s resounding
howls were lost in the din as the Indians, uttering
their appalling yells, dashed towards her. Like an
arrow from a bow, fleet as a young fawn, Diana sprang
forward, several of the dusky braves starting in hot
pursuit. She had some advantage of distance in the
start, but so close were her pursuers that the slightest
hesitation, a false step, a slip on the sunburnt grass,
would prove fatal. The footsteps of her foremost
pursuer fell with growing clearness upon her ears.
With every muscle strained to its utmost tension on
she flew, all the while conscious that the foe was
steadily gaining upon her. She had almost reached
the threshold of the fort when, shouting his own
name in the Indian fashion, the Iroquois stretched
out his hand to grasp her shoulder. She could feel
the touch of his fingers upon the lace border of the
kerchief she wore around her neck. At this instant
the report of a pistol rang out. With a sharp, convulsive
shudder the savage sprang high in the air and
fell prostrate to the ground, as Diane, breathless and
trembling, was drawn into the fort by du Chesne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A prescient excitement blazed in the young man’s
eyes. His spirited face was full of resolution and
confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear not, Diane,” he said, as he barricaded the
door, “there are not a great number of Iroquois
gathered outside, and they rarely attack a fort. Our
most serious danger is that the sound of the guns
may induce my father to return, and that from the
shore they will fire upon the boats. We are safe
enough here, but we must not allow them to suspect
that our garrison is so small. I have already posted
the men; we can only await the attack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane sank down faint and sick, yet with a sweet
consolatory thought underlying her physical weakness.
Whatever might happen she would not be
obliged to endure alone; she could depend upon a
sympathy and companionship she highly prized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Jean, where is he?” du Chesne continued, as
though he wished to give her time to recover herself.
“<span class='it'>Pasembleau!</span> that lazy varlet has no heart for
fighting; that I’ll swear. Nanon, thou canst manage
an arquebus as well as any man among them. My
brave girl, we will need thy help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nanon’s black eyes darted furious glances as she
ground her teeth in sheer wrath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Monsieur, I am capable of that, and may I
put an end to one of these sorcerers, these brigands,
with every shot I fire! My hairs are all rubbed the
wrong way at the sight of these wolves. Chut!
Mademoiselle, why so pale? I think little of these
affairs, me; still there is no laughing under the nose
when it relates to the Iroquois. Sit far back if you
would not see, and for a high-born demoiselle I
grant—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Nanon,” Diane interposed, repulsing the well-intentioned
offers of assistance. “Whatever befalls
the others I share, since our lot has been cast together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With an exultant throb the girl’s spirit leaped free
from its chains. Amidst these perilous circumstances
she was conscious of feeling a perfect courage and
serenity. Turning his head, du Chesne smiled at her
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Place yourself behind me, Diane; you can help
by loading as I fire. We will stand on our defence.
These wolves will lurk about and try to climb into
the fort under the cover of darkness. We must not
permit them to approach, lest they set fire to the roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Iroquois showed no disposition to retire, but
commenced industriously to erect barricades of stones
and bushes, as though notwithstanding the check they
had encountered they were resolved to begin a prolonged
siege.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks as though it may be late before we reach
Ville Marie. B-r-r-r-r! The tongue of our good
Nanon goes like the clapper of a mill. Well, she
amuses the soldiers, and she is as ready to aid with
the hands as the voice. These savages take us for
targets, do they? When the violins play, then is the
time to dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bibelot kept up a continuous barking, which added
to the tumult. Nanon’s wrathful denunciations of the
enemy delighted the soldiers and soothed her own
nerves, even if they failed to annihilate the assailants.
Thus the little party contrived to keep up their spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane, keeping close behind du Chesne, loading one
gun as he fired another, standing ready to obey his
behests, had time to think of many things. Her eyes
rested upon the young man with growing amazement.
It was an hour of revelation. All the careless boyishness
of his face had been replaced by an expression
keen, stern, resolute; his eyes flamed with a light
which was almost cruel in its intensity. There was
something splendid in the stalwart pride of courage.
Watching this novel moulding of the familiar features,
the girl was beset by a strange sense of unreality.
This was no longer her boyish comrade whom she had
teased and flattered and cajoled; this was a man
strong to command, to defy fate, who would rise
equal to every crisis, and who would grow with every
emergency. An absorbing feeling took possession of
Diane’s mind, her heart swelled with a new spring of
impassioned emotion, a subtle intoxication mounted
like fire to her brain. It dawned upon her that du
Chesne was a hero, and that he had counted her
worthy of aiding him in his extremity. This thought
flushed her horizon with the sunshine of heroic impulse.
Her face was full of a tense eagerness, almost beyond
the artifices of concealment. Once speaking, she ventured
rather breathlessly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen are born to shed their blood for God
and the King.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That goes without saying,” he replied quietly.
Du Chesne had had so much experience of Indian
warfare that he accepted encounters such as this as a
matter of course. “When the end has to come, a day
sooner or later, what does it matter?” Then his
buoyant temperament reasserting itself, he added,
“Bah! Diane, our hour is not yet. You looked so
pale and so serious you made me almost shiver. This
is but a brush with these wolves. Very different
would it be were we out in the open, far from the protection
of the fort; then would there be occasion for
grimaces. What is that? Look, Diane!” Then his
voice rose in a glad cry. His keen eyes had discovered
a swarm of canoes, thick as a flight of blackbirds
in autumn, on the waters of the Ottawa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aid is at hand! I was not sure that this might
not be a reinforcement of Iroquois, in which case we
were lost; but no, these are our own allies. Saved!
Do you hear, Diane? Saved!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane sank on her knees. Her face shone with
that spiritual light with which at moments of supreme
feeling the soul illumines its earthly tenement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The good Lord has saved us from the hands of
our enemies.” The girl could have wept with thankfulness
and delight, but controlled herself by an effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, and our lady of Bonsecours shall have three
as fine waxen tapers burning before her shrine as
money can buy, and that before the week is out,”
Nanon protested excitedly. “I make no clamor for
all the world to hear, like that vulture Mam’selle
Anne, but I make my religion all the same. Never
could I believe that the holy saints could be so ungrateful
and inconsiderate as to refuse to listen to the
prayers of my demoiselle.”</p>

from their canoes and advancing through a
ridge of thick forest beyond the open fields, scores
of half-naked savages swarmed into the clearing.
Ensconced behind the ramparts of the fort, the little
band watched the proceedings in silence. Through
the leafy arches of the woods, over hill and hollow,
across still swamp and gurgling brook, rang the war-whoops
of the new arrivals as they rushed upon their
hereditary foes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is now the turn of the wolves to dance, and we
can assist at the festivities!” exclaimed du Chesne,
hilariously. “This is a war party of Hurons and
Algonquins returning from an expedition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Iroquois, though taken by surprise, fought with
courage and address, leaping and dodging among
the trees and rocks until at last, finding themselves
outnumbered and overborne, they retreated,
bearing the wounded and most of their dead with
them. As the tumult of the conflict died away, the
young Frenchman observed in a tone of satisfaction,
“It is settled. Have no apprehensions, Diane; our
adversaries have fled, carrying something to remember
us by as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it, then, quite certain, M’sieur, that they have
gone, but beyond doubt,” pleaded a timorous voice
from some remote depth of obscurity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wretched coward! of much use thou hast been.
And where hast thou hidden thy miserable carcase?”
returned du Chesne in hot anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scaramouch! screech-owl! much help thou hast
been in saving my demoiselle and me,” Nanon
mocked one of her most constant admirers. “Oh,
that I were entrusted with the wringing of thy
unworthy neck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With an insinuating smile on his sleek, fat face
the valet crept out from the dark corner which had
afforded him shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ouf! that such should exist!” the young commandant
cried contemptuously. “Poltroon! art thou
not ashamed to show thy face?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, M’sieur du Chesne; figure to yourself—it is
quite simple,” with an affectation of innocent frankness.
“It is the nature of M’sieur to be courageous,
to love fighting—it is well. It is the delight of
Nanon to chatter. It is Bibelot’s instinct to hate
the savages; you observe even the smell of one
throws her into a frenzy. For me, I have an invincible
repugnance to the scalping knife of the Iroquois.
Had I permitted myself to be killed M’sieur would
have lost a faithful servant, and these pagans would
have added a fresh sin to the list of their enormities.
May I ask, M’sieur, is it the duty of good Christians
to tempt the heathen? Should they not rather give an
example of patience and resignation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new arrivals now claimed attention. Sunburned
warriors they were, of tall stalwart build,
limbed like statues. Success had crowned their
arms, as shown in the imposing array of scalps and
the necklaces of ears and fingers which many of them
wore. They looked like painted spectres, grotesquely
horrible in horns and tails; their faces painted red or
green, with black or white spots; their ears and noses
hung with ornaments of iron, and their naked bodies
daubed with figures of various animals. These fierce,
capricious braves smiled upon the fiery young soldier
whose courage had long since won their approbation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, my brother, we have arrived in time to
strengthen your arm against our foes?” exclaimed the
principal war chief. “The face of our white brother
is welcome to the eyes of Howaha.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last time du Chesne had met Howaha was at
the annual fair in Ville Marie, when he appeared in a
picturesque attire befitting his dignity and rank. He
was much less imposing now as he squatted on the
grass after his triumphs, chopping rank tobacco with a
scalping-knife. An astute old savage, well trained in
arts of policy, he showed every disposition to render
himself agreeable to the son of the influential French
trader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But look, du Chesne! Here is a white prisoner—a
woman, too. Oh, surely she is not dead!” cried
Diane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not dead, Diane, but evidently overcome by
fatigue and fright. Howaha tells me she is a New
England girl whom they have taken. She has been
given to one of the chiefs, Nitchoua, to replace a wife
he lost during the winter. Had it not been for that
she would have been butchered on the spot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An English heretic! Take care, then, Mademoiselle;
she may have the evil eye. True sorcerers
are these English; it is said they devour little children,
even to the bones. No doubt they are wicked,
and of a wickedness truly terrible—yet this one has
not the appearance of a veritable monster,” continued
Nanon with wavering positiveness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the lethargy of utter exhaustion, her limbs
relaxed and nerveless, the girl lay on the grass just
as she had been thrown by the Indians. She seemed
utterly unconscious of the clamor of voices or of the
curious regard directed towards her, as though in the
terrible numbness of despair she had grown indifferent
to her fate. Her features were delicately formed, her
complexion of an exquisite purity, yet so utterly devoid
of color that she resembled a beautiful statue
rather than a living woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane, feeling that inexplicable attraction which
frequently draws together persons of entirely different
natures, examined her closely. The novel sensations
and sentiments so recently awakened within her
endowed all existence with a new pathos as well as a
new delight. She knelt down beside the captive girl,
smoothing the flaxen hair which the sunlight turned
to gold, clasping the cold, passive hands in her own,
whispering soft words of comfort and encouragement.
The stranger stared vacantly into the French girl’s
face, while Diane’s brilliant eyes dimmed with the
sympathetic moisture of compassion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There has been a violent dispute concerning the
prisoner,” explained du Chesne, who understood the
Indian dialects perfectly; “Nitchoua wishes to take
her as his wife. Another party want to torture her
when they reach their own village, and Howaha has
threatened to settle the dispute by a blow with a
tomahawk which will terminate at once the discussion
and the existence of the captive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How beautiful she is! She is already half dead
with misery and fatigue; I can scarcely feel her heart
beat.” A keen compassion pleaded in the intensity
of Diane’s faltering accents. “You know what captivity
among the Indians means. Think of this tender
creature submitted to the torture. I should know no
rest all the remainder of my life for thinking of it.
This might have been our own case had not the Holy
Virgin sent us aid. We can never desert her in her
extremity—you must find some way of ransoming
her, du Chesne—you can surely manage it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know. There is the merest pinch of
hope; but I will do my best to save her, Diane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same thought already had crossed the young
man’s mind. The chief impression made upon him by
this stranger was one of helpless beauty and innocence.
He was chivalrous and tender-hearted, yet he comprehended
that the rescue of the prisoner was secondary
in importance to propitiating these savage allies. In
the one case the fate of an individual depended upon
his exertions; in the other the fate of the whole settlement
might hang in the balance. In their attempts
to resist the encroachments of the Iroquois the French
could not do without the help of the other Indian
tribes. Du Chesne thoroughly understood the art of
dealing with these children of the forest. He could
conform to their customs and flatter them with courteous
address. He understood the uncertain, vacillating
temper common to all savages. Unsteady as
aspens, fierce as panthers, rent by mad jealousies, they
were a wild crew who changed their intentions with
the veering of the wind, and whose dancing, singing
and yelling might at any moment turn into war-whoops
against each other or against the French.
There were many difficulties to be considered, but the
young Canadian was not easily daunted, and he
determined to make the effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nerving every faculty for the endeavor, the youth
stood forth, his full deep eyes fixed on the savages
with the masterful scrutiny with which a tamer of wild
beasts might regard the ferocious animals committed
to his charge. His dark eyes were aflame; there was
so much of quiet strength suggested in his bearing
that, as she listened to his glowing words, Diane’s
heart beat high with pride. The daughter of a race
of soldiers, she was deeply imbued with admiration
for physical courage. With bold adroitness he assured
Howaha that if his captive had become a subject of
dissension among the red-men, he, their white brother,
ever ready to oblige his allies, was willing to relieve
them of the burden. He imitated the prolonged
accents of the savages and addressed them in turn by
their respective tribes, bands and families, calling their
men of note by name as though he had been born
among them. In all he said his voice and gestures
answered to the words. The chiefs, silent and attentive,
with gaze riveted upon the bowls of their pipes,
listened with cool, impartial interest. Plainly the impression
made by the young Canadian’s eloquence was
favorable; at every pause in his harangue some sign
of approval could be detected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Du Chesne did not, however, gain his object without
some trouble. At one moment Nitchoua started
forward, brandishing his hatchet in the air, declaring
furiously that the prisoner belonged to him by right
of war; rather than waive his claim he would kill her
as she lay helpless before them. “Has Nitchoua killed
enemies on the war-path? His arm is weary with
killing, his eye with counting. The scalps of his
enemies ornament the wigwam of the great chief in
such number that they shelter it from rain in the
stormy night,” vaunted the fierce savage, proclaiming
his own deeds of valor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English maiden was too far spent to be greatly
excited by this new menace. She understood neither
the French language nor the Indian dialects, even had
she been able to control herself sufficiently to listen.
Occurrences had been struck off by time in such quick
succession that they seemed like some terrible continuous
nightmare—an awful void in which every
wretchedness was conceivable, and in which there was
neither comfort nor solace to be found. She was not
by nature endowed with nerve or courage. Within
the last few days she had become familiar with scenes
of massacre and pillage; she had seen her home
burned to the ground, her relatives butchered before
her eyes, had witnessed the cruel torture of friends
and neighbors, had endured incredible fatigue, and
had realized the uncertainty concerning her own fate.
Now the overstrained brain refused to receive fresh
impressions, a merciful lethargy deadened sensation.
When the excited savage waved his axe above her
head, though she believed her last hour had come,
even in this extremity she had not sufficient strength
to arouse herself. Prompted by some instinct, her
blue eyes turned to Diane with a mute agonized
appeal. The French girl returned the gaze with
a sob of excitement and agitation swelling at her
throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must take care of you, it is our bounden duty—we
could not fail you—trust us,” she pleaded, unconscious
or careless of the fact that the stranger could
not know the meaning of her words. There is, however,
a language of the soul which the most distraught
can comprehend in the face of a great crisis. As she
met the kindly glance bent upon her, a ray of comfort
penetrated the darkness which had enveloped the
captive’s spirit; it was like an ethereal stimulant
quickening all her powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, on the promise of a rich ransom being
given, Nitchoua allowed his wrath to be appeased.
He began to dance, holding his hands upraised as
though apostrophizing the sky. Suddenly he seized
his tomahawk, brandished it wildly, and then flung it
far from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus I throw away my anger,” he shouted; “so I
cast away my weapons of blood and war. Let the
pale-face girl be led away to the wigwams of the
French, since my white brother desires it to be so.
We are friends forever. Candwish,<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> we are brothers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A swift expression of relief, like a flash of light,
crossed du Chesne’s face. Howaha arose, and with
an air of great dignity said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brothers, it is well. Farewell, war; farewell,
tomahawk; no longer have we use for you. We
have often been fools, henceforth we will learn
wisdom. The French are our brothers; Onontio<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> is
our father. Brother, our covenant with you is a silver
chain which can neither break nor rust. We are of
the race of the Bear, and as long as there is a drop of
blood in his veins the bear never yields to force; but
the ear of the bear is ever open to the voice of a
friend. Take the prisoner, she is yours; do with her
what you will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fawn”—du Chesne pointed to Diane, who
still clasped the English girl in her arms,—“will
adopt the captive as a sister; she will find shelter in
the lodges of the French.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye,” Howaha added gravely, “the snow-flower
will know peace. Shall the bird in its nest dread the
wind and tempest? shall the child in the arms of its
mother know fear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Realizing that the whim of the savages might
change like a drift of dry leaves, du Chesne had no
idea of resting in false security. “We will seize the
opportunity of going down the river with Howaha,”
he decided promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later, as they floated down with the current, the
Indians chanted their songs of victory, as an accompaniment
striking the edges of their paddles against
the sides of their bark canoes. First one wild voice
raised itself in strange discordant tones, now dropping
low, then rising again, anon swelling into shrill yelps
in which all the others joined. Among them two
Iroquois prisoners stood upright, shouting their own
war-songs in proud defiance, like men who knew no
fear of torture or death, while from seven poles raised
aloft as many fresh scalps fluttered in the evening
breeze. Though the vermilion dusk still lingered
over Mount Royal, softly purple in the fading light,
the moon, pearly and splendid, swung high in the
east, accompanied by a vaguely scintillating star at
the zenith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it came to pass that the Puritan damsel, Lydia
Longloy, entered upon a new existence, protected by
Diane de Monesthrol’s tender care, succored by the
charity of those French papists the very sound of
whose name had until now been a terror to her. The
only person who appeared dissatisfied with the turn
events had taken was Nanon, who grumbled as she
told her beads:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An extra rosary I must say in order to avert the
evil eye. It may even be her ill-luck my little
mistress is carrying with her in the shape of this
English heretic. We have had sufficient of that, we
others, when it has landed us among the savages;
and where next—who can tell? But for our
demoiselle it should be another matter; for her it
must be only sunshine.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HE house occupied by Jacques Le Ber in Ville
Marie stood at the corner of St. Paul and
St. Joseph streets. The front windows commanded a
view of the St. Lawrence, while those at the back
overlooked undulating meadows and woodlands,
crowned by Mount Royal, on whose summit, amidst
the thick foliage, gleamed the tall cross which in fulfilment
of his vow Maisonneuve had himself borne up
the steep mountain track. The house was a substantial
building, long and low, with high peaked roof and
overhanging eaves. The rooms were large, with low
ceilings and immense chimneys taking up half one
side of the wall. The furnishings bore evidence of
wealth and comfort, displayed in old chairs and
tabourets, their covers worked in satin stitch, the
buffet and tables of cherry-wood all in plain solid
bourgeois style. On either side of the street door
were placed wooden benches, where the family and
visitors gathered for recreation in the summer evenings.
In a wing or annex adjoining was the shop,
the foundation of the successful trader’s wealth, in
which were stored quantities of beaver-skins awaiting
shipment to France, as well as various commodities
required by the settlers, and such provisions as were
considered necessary in fitting out the voyageurs for
their long expeditions to the West and for purposes
of trade with the Indian tribes. At the back of the
house the garden bloomed with fragrant, old-fashioned
flowers; there, too, carefully cultivated pear and
plum trees revived a memory of Old France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Le Ber’s own family consisted of but a
daughter and three sons, the household was a large
one. His home was a capacious abode, extending a
kindly welcome to all who might care to seek its
shelter. And it was always full to overflowing;
friends, relatives, guests, servants and retainers
thronged the roomy chambers. As at the settlement,
its occupants were divided into two clearly defined
parties who were always at daggers drawn—the
worldly and the devout. In its earliest days Ville
Marie had been regulated like a religious community.
The mental atmosphere was saturated with hare-brained
enthusiasm; it was an age of miracles—the
very existence of the little colony was a marvel. But
the severity of the ecclesiastical rule and the unrelenting
vigilance of the Jesuits were resented by many
of the more worldly spirits. In the midst of pressing
dangers and heroic struggles there was a natural
reaction in favor of the frivolous gaiety so characteristic
of the volatile French temperament. The
presence of a number of officers from France, too,
whose piety was less conspicuous than their love of
pleasure, served to keep this spirit of resistance
alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wealthy burgher’s home had, owing to his
daughter’s renunciation of the world and its pleasures,
acquired a peculiar sanctity in the eyes of his co-religionists.
She, the richest heiress of New France,
had in the bloom of her youth taken a vow of perpetual
seclusion, poverty and chastity, in order to
devote herself to a life of contemplation. The god-child
of Chomody de Maisonneuve and Marguerite
Bourgeois, brought up in an atmosphere of visions
and miracles, the halo of saintship glittered before
her young eyes like a diamond crown, and she entertained
a firm determination to scale the steepest
heights of virtue and self-sacrifice. Looking down
with spiritual pride upon the common herd of Christians,
busied with the ordinary duties of life, she
eschewed the visible and present, aspiring only to
live for the heaven beyond. Lost in the vagaries of
an absorbing mysticism, Jeanne Le Ber was unrelenting
in the practice of humiliation and self-abnegation.
Wonderful stories of her superior sanctity
were whispered abroad. She wore a horse-hair skirt
and belt, allowed herself scarcely any sleep, and confined
her diet to the coarsest and meanest of food.
She held no communication with those nearest to her
by ties of blood. Two years after her retirement
from the world her mother was attacked by fatal
illness, and though the sound of the poor woman’s
groans penetrated to her daughter’s chamber, the
would-be saint denied herself the privilege of attending
her parent’s death-bed. Though Jeanne Le Ber’s
face was never seen except by the one person who
waited upon her, nor her voice ever heard by those
most closely connected with her, yet from the
secluded chamber which for several years she had
never quitted, that voiceless presence exercised a
potent ascendency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This influence had operated most powerfully upon
her brother Pierre, a youth of mystical tendencies.
Sensitive, full of refinement, quick and impatient as a
thoroughbred, he had been one of Charon’s early
associates—the only one who remained faithful to
the end. Possessing keen artistic perceptions, he yet
lacked power of execution. Few in the colony had
either leisure or inclination for the cultivation of the
fine arts, and Pierre Le Ber’s paintings were received
by his contemporaries with an admiration untinged
by criticism. His early training had predisposed
him to aceticism, but his natural temperament,
against which he battled with ceaseless resistance,
inclined him to a sensuous delight in beauty, harmony,
and brightness. His religion was that of the
affections and sentiments; his imagination, warmed
by the ardor of his faith, shaped the ideal forms of his
worship into visible realities. He displayed a curious
ingenuity in inventing torments for himself, wearing
a belt covered with sharp points, whipping himself
with a scourge of small cords until his shoulders were
one great wound, playing at beggar, eating mouldy
food, and performing the most repulsive and disagreeable
offices in hospitals. More than once the
rich merchant’s eldest son had been seen staggering
through St. Paul Street with a lame beggar, whom he
was bearing through the mud, seated on his back.
As Jacques Le Ber de Senneville, the second son,
was a man of the world of fashion and of courts, and
Jean Le Ber du Chesne a man of action and energy,
so Pierre was a dreamer of dreams, a beholder of
visions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The relations between Le Ber and the Marquise de
Monesthrol had at one time furnished gossip to the
small community at Ville Marie, which, during the
long winter months cut off from the world, had little
but scandal to serve as a diversion. On his return
from a voyage to France the merchant was accompanied
by the Marquise (a perfect type of the <span class='it'>grande
dame</span> of the period), a child two years old, and a
young attendant. Even to his closest friends Le Ber
had never offered further explanation than to say that
in his youth he had been under obligations to Madame
de Monesthrol’s family, and that on his return to
France, finding her widowed and in trouble, he had
been proud to offer her a home for herself and her
orphan niece in the New World. The lady on her
part always warmly acknowledged her indebtedness
to the Canadian merchant. People coming out from
France brought rumors of great pecuniary trouble
which had fallen upon Madame’s branch of the
family, and of a terrible tragedy which had deprived
her of her husband; but the most rampant curiosity
sank abashed before the lady’s dignified grace, while
the maid Nanon’s sharp tongue and ready wit were
capable of repulsing all intrusive questions. Though
Diane persisted in calling Le Ber her uncle, and in
claiming his sons as cousins, it was plain that no tie
of blood existed between them. The line of demarcation
between patrician and plebeian was very clearly
defined in those days; no one could doubt the claim
of the de Monesthrols to noble birth—indeed the
family was one of the most noble and powerful of the
kingdom of France—while Le Ber boasted of no
pretension higher than the respectable <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was the obligation altogether on one side. It
was whispered that even in her fallen fortunes the
Marquise retained considerable influence at Court,
that the appointment of Le Ber’s second son as one of
the Dauphin’s pages, and later his commission in the
Marines, had been due to her influence, and that the
patent of nobility upon which the trader had set his
heart would yet be obtained by the same favor.
While anxious to obtain a high place for himself and
his children in the heavenly kingdom, Le Ber’s affections
had by no means become alienated from the
affairs of this world. It was conjectured by those
who knew him best that a sincere reverence for rank
was one of his prominent traits. As his daughter’s
aspirations after saintliness conferred upon him an
especial distinction with the ecclesiastical authorities,
so the Marquise’s sojourn beneath his roof bestowed
upon his home a stamp of fashion and exclusiveness
to which he otherwise would have had no pretension.
A patent of nobility had, some time before, been conferred
upon his brother-in-law, Charles le Moyne, and
it was bitter to the ambitious man that his own sons
should be debarred from wearing the sword with
which his nephews swaggered so gallantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though born and bred in the focus of a most gorgeous
civilization, reared like a princess amidst
obsequious troops of vassals and retainers, having
enjoyed a life of wit and splendor amidst a brilliant
and dazzling society, and then suddenly, in her
downfall, banished away to the ends of the earth,
surrounded by perils and privations, Madame de
Monesthrol wasted no time in vain regrets. Like
many another of her class, she displayed a marvellous
power of accommodating herself to circumstances
and extracting pleasure and profit from them. In
her former life she had loved, rejoiced and suffered
with her whole heart; now there was nothing for it
but to make acquaintance with the practical and
inexorable. She coolly counted chances and weighed
consequences, and then, fully and freely, accepted the
situation and its conditions. A submissive spirit
might be patient, a strong will could supply resolution;
here existed an elastic mind, a willingness to
seek comfort, a power of turning readily from evil to
good, and of finding enjoyment in many simple occupations
which carried her away from the memory of
her sorrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her fantastic French desire to act the new role
to perfection she would fain have adapted herself
more quickly than was possible to her new surroundings.
She saw no reason why, with all the ease of a
woman of the world and the loftiness of a great lady,
she should not sell in the shop or undertake a share
of the superintendence of the domestic affairs, as Le
Ber’s wife had done. She was promptly called from
these delusions by Demoiselle<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> Le Ber’s bewildered
consternation, Nanon’s shrill clamor, and more than
all by the shocked and genuine distress of the trader
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am well aware, Madam la Marquise, that the
home I have been able to offer is entirely unworthy
your dignity. Have I failed in showing my appreciation
of the honor your coming has conferred upon
me that you should treat me thus?” the host reproached
his guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even a dog can die,” the lady replied with spirit.
“I am not of puddle blood—I, Adrienne Monesthrol—that
I should perish at the first breath of adversity.
Still, my old and good friend, to whom I owe so
much”—Madame laid her white jewelled hand upon
the merchant’s arm, and when she softened there was
something wonderfully winning in this woman’s proud
gentleness—“if it pleases you best that I should
remain seated like an image I must even yield, and
give up all hope of being useful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Le Ber kissed the gracious hand respectfully,
for by him the French lady was encircled with a halo
of reverence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perceiving that her well-intentioned efforts had
failed, Madame, philosophically reviewing all the
facts of the case, graciously permitted herself to
remain upon the pedestal where the loyalty of her
devoted friend had placed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In New France the appendages of an old-established
civilization flourished side by side with the rough
usages of an almost unbroken wilderness. Amidst
the solid comforts of this bourgeois home, the Marquise
established a little court over which she reigned
by sheer majesty, ruling without effort or design,
governing because it was her nature so to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame’s bedroom, which was the great chamber
of reception, was always warm and heavily perfumed.
In the upper part the bed was placed, raised above
the rest of the room by a few steps, and further
divided from it by a row of slight low pillars. The
bed was an immense four-poster, seven feet each way,
with gauze and silk curtains, and a blue satin counterpane
embroidered with convolvulus and carnations.
The space beside the bed, called the <span class='it'>ruelle</span>, was furnished
sumptuously with pictures, statuettes, vases,
gilded mirrors, fancy tables of buhl and ormolu, chairs
and stools of various kinds covered with satin and
destined to accommodate Madame’s guests with wise
adaptation to the rank and pretensions of each.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the window on a stand were pots of flowers,
and in small tubs bloomed orange trees, above which
hung canaries in gilt cages. There were strips of
Persian carpets on the floor; mirrors gleamed in
filigree frames; a harpsichord stood in the corner.
The chairs were of gilt ebony with cushions in tambour.
Opposite Madame’s chair hung the portrait of
a young man, in lace cravat and half armor, the
<span class='it'>cordon bleu</span> of the Order of St. Louis worn conspicuously
across his velvet coat. The face was gay,
reckless, handsome; and before the picture hung a
veil of silken gauze. Most people supposed this to be
the portrait of the Marquise’s husband; Diane knew
that it was that of the Marquis’ younger brother, her
own father, the Chevalier Raoul Anatole de Monesthrol,
who had been killed while fighting with the
King’s armies in Flanders. On the 12th of May every
year the Marquise spent the day in fasting and prayer.
Though the subject was never alluded to, nor explanations
ever offered, the young girl understood that
this custom was in some way connected with her
father’s death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A draped recess held an ivory crucifix and a Book
of Hours. A trailing ruby velvet curtain veiled the
door. A quaint sensuous charm hung about the
apartment, which was enhanced by the stately figure
of the lady herself. Like others of her station,
Madame, however heavy at heart, was consummate
mistress of her outward behavior. She sat with
fan hanging on one arm and jewelled snuff-box
within reach, her mobile aristocratic features displayed
to advantage by her dress, a panniered robe
of blue and silver brocade. Madame’s common employment
consisted in unpicking gold lace, which
Le Ber disposed of for her in the regular market as
bullion.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:.9em;'><span class='it'>MADAME’S “APARTEMENT.”</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>E</span>VERY evening, when Le Ber was at home, he
went up to kiss Madame’s hand, inquire how
she did, or to play cards with her until the supper was
served at seven. Madame was gracious, with a sense
of supremacy and privilege; many a lesson in worldly
wisdom, too, the shrewd trader received from the
witty and sagacious woman of the world. Le Ber
had been brought up on the estate of the Marquise’s
father, and the two, though so strangely dissimilar,
had many points of interest in common.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquise de Monesthrol was partial to receptions
in bed. On such occasions she wore a white
satin jacket, white gloves, a cornette or morning cap
of exquisite lace, and had the card-table so placed
that she could join in the game without awkwardness.
The visitors received greetings in tone apparently
easy and natural, yet in reality framed and graduated
with the most exquisite tact. In this Madame
resembled the great lady who enjoyed the reputation
of being so thoroughly well-bred that one could tell
merely from her pronunciation of the word “Monseigneur”
whether she were speaking to a Prince of
the blood, an ecclesiastical dignitary, or a peer of
France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame also enjoyed her evening “<span class='it'>apartement</span>,”
commencing at seven and ending at ten, whither her
guests gathered to play lasquenet, hombre and brélan,
while in the intervals between the deals Jean handed
around frothed chocolate and muscat on a massive
silver tray chased with armorial bearings. These
receptions were a centre of wit—a wit delicate and
subtle, but always natural and agreeable; they
brought with them a reminiscence of the dazzling
days of the lady’s youth. Most of the party gathered
there had passed through manifold troubles. In many
cases it was misfortune which had driven them to
quit their native land; disease, famine and death now
stared them constantly in the face, yet they were proud
and high-hearted, presenting an indomitable front to
adversity. The common people might bewail their
troubles—that was the privilege of their low estate—but
whatever the dire necessity, the pressing emergency
of the moment, it would have been deemed the
height of ill-breeding for any of the Marquise’s coterie
to allude to any subject not capable of amusing and
interesting the entire company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a punctilious French circle, polished and
occasionally extremely brilliant, in which refined
artifice and trained coquetry were constantly exhibited;
where a leader cleverly conducted the conversation
and each individual present was under an
obligation to contribute his or her share to the
general entertainment. The men stood deferentially
behind the high-backed chairs, treating skilfully the
topics which the women had touched with dexterous
grace. The conversation was cynical and epigrammatic,
but always amusing. The Marquise was
herself an accomplished talker. The light sarcastic
humor, subtle touches, unsparing irony or ridicule—always
kept within conventional bounds—with which
her conversation flashed and sparkled, permeated the
little circle and charmed all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she permitted her thoughts to dwell upon
the subject (which was but seldom, for in her philosophic
fortitude Madame objected to idle repinings),
the Marquise thought that she had died when she left
France—died to hope, and love and ambition,—and
in this new world had revived again a sort of ghost of
her former self to confront another existence. She
could not dwell forever amidst the crumbling ruins of
her life; an entirely new array of troubles and difficulties
had to be met, which nevertheless had a novel
side, and took her mind from her own wounds. It
might be painful to flesh and blood, but the cup had
to be drained. The climax and agony of her youth
had been left behind; it still remained to tread with
calmness the dark paths that stretched before her.
In that case it was well to make endurance as
pleasant as possible, to accept every solace and
alleviation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Marquise represented the sceptical, worldly
element in the household. While Le Ber’s bourgeois
tastes and habits prevented him from feeling much
sympathy with those of his noble guests, he greatly
prided himself upon Madame’s social supremacy. He
had no paltry vanity to obscure his clear perceptions,
and his unquestioned autocracy was mellowed by a
fine instinct of kindly courtesy. There were others
more narrow-minded and less tolerant, but their ill-natured
comments were ignored by the great lady.
She held it becoming in a woman of quality not to
fail in religious observances, but it was her nature to
inspect everything curiously, to fathom intentions and
analyze motives, and then to form her own judgments.
Her enemies hinted that the Marquise had
been infected by the Jansenist doctrines and that she
had Jansenist books in her possession. She listened
to all that was said, smiled suavely, but never altered
her intention of not allowing her actions to be regulated
by the narrow dogmas of the Jesuits. She still
enjoyed her quiet game of piquet with Père Denys, a
kindly and amusing man with a keen sense of humor,
read the books which suited her, and exercised a
charitable tolerance unknown to the fanatics by
whom she was surrounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane was the heaviest weight upon Madame’s
heart. For herself she had done with all things, made
the sacrifice of all things, but the child was young, all
life lay before her. Had the demoiselle de Monesthrol
remained in France she might have been
received among the <span class='it'>dames nièces</span> of Remiremont, that
refuge for penniless young girls of high lineage; but
in the colony, with all the outlooks of life uncertain,
who could predict what the fate of a dowerless damsel
might be? As Madame’s opinion of colonial education
was not high, she resolutely refused to send her
niece to the Ursulines at Quebec, thus again scandalizing
the clerical authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would I see Diane a child of the pavement? a
goat-herd—a little peasant? <span class='it'>Seigneur dieu!</span> what a
horror! The loss of fortune may previously have
afflicted us, but greatly as that is to be deplored,
what is it to the lack of breeding?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame de Monesthrol imparted to her niece the
graces and accomplishments of which she was herself
mistress, while Nanon took pride in instructing a
quick if somewhat volatile and mischievous pupil in
many useful domestic arts. The result was a broader
culture, a wider range of sympathy, than could well
have been gained in the seclusion of a convent.
Climatic influences and the peculiar condition of
colonial life had modified, not indeed the French
lady’s ideas of education, but the results derived
from her system. In the hardy adventurous condition
of New France, with every faculty called into
play, and a constant demand on every energy, it was
quite impossible that even a young girl of noble birth
should retain the utter ignorance of the world, the
absence of self-assertion, supposed to characterize the
traditional French <span class='it'>jeune personne</span>. Madame watched
this development with interest, curiosity, and some
amazement, but always remained strictly and philosophically
impartial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I answer to you for it, Nanon, it was not so in my
time,” she explained to her faithful attendant, who
was the only person to whom the lady ever really
extended her confidence. “I was timid and sensitive.
I scarcely dared raise my eyes when M. le Marquis
de Monesthrol was presented as my <span class='it'>futur</span>, the day I
left the convent. Diane knows no fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Madame la Marquise, and we have all seen
the evil that comes of that sort of thing,” was the
daring comment ventured by the waiting-maid; “let
our demoiselle have a chance for happiness in another
way.” For an instant the Marquise’s face looked wan
and haggard, but she quickly recovered herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happiness—where is it?” she mocked. “But for
the little one’s fortune—I cannot make it, I must not
mar. Misfortune has fallen upon our generation;
Diane may be favored with a happier lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our demoiselle is of the best; noble and brave
and generous to the core,” asserted Nanon confidently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very early marriages were the rule in the colony,
yet at eighteen Diane de Monesthrol, the fairest girl
in New France, still remained unwed. The demoiselle
Fresnoy Carion, her youthful companion and Le
Ber’s ward, who had married Le Moyne de St. Helène,
at the same age was already a staid matron, the
proud mother of two curly-headed little ones. Many
matches had been proposed, but the girl seemed to
be capricious and always raised objections, and Le
Ber was invariably won over to support her side of
the question. Had Madame in any case really
exerted her authority opposition would have been
useless, but some subtle intuition born of her own
tragic experience caused her to refrain from doing so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am perhaps not doing my duty by the child in
not settling the affair at once,” Madame ventured to
say to her protector. “Should an occasion entirely
favorable arise I should undoubtedly do so. Who is
there to marry here but priests, partridges and wild
turkeys? Say, is it not so, my friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Le Ber gravely agreed to the Marquise’s assertion.
His ambitions were guided by so clear a sagacity that
he rarely was forced to recede from a position once
taken. He had his own ideas on the subject, which
he kept strictly to himself. There was no hurry to
seek an establishment for Diane de Monesthrol. His
daughter and his eldest son were striving to establish
themselves amidst the highest ranks of the heavenly
aristocracy; it should be right to obtain for his
younger sons similar worldly advantages. To what
might not du Chesne aspire were his claims to consideration
strengthened by an alliance with the noble
family of de Monesthrol, who still possessed powerful
connections in France? If no more advantageous
offer presented itself Madame might in time be induced
to overlook the presumption of his proposal; she was
above all things eminently reasonable. It would be
impossible to leave the girl alone in the world exposed
to the buffets of fate. He would wait patiently
for the realization of his plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne Barroy, a cousin and poor relative of Le Ber’s,
who acted as attendant to the recluse and was the
only one who ever came into personal contact with
Jeanne Le Ber, headed the priestly faction in the
house. Anne was an exaggerated example of the
extreme opinions that obtained in Ville Marie at that
date. She had a stealthy way of moving about, with
eyes cast down and hands folded meekly in front of
her, as with pious ostentation she groaned aves and
paters. Nanon boldly declared that Mam’selle Anne
had eyes in the back of her head, and a nose long
enough to reach the utmost limits of everybody’s
business. This good woman entertained profound
convictions of the worthlessness and wickedness of
the world in general; she also deeply disapproved of
the Marquise and her niece, and evinced a principle
of active antagonism to Nanon, whose powers of
sharp retort, audacity, and sauciness rendered her
a formidable adversary. Her mind was forever
dwelling upon their iniquities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They revel with fontanges and panniers, coquetry
and late suppers,” she lamented, “forgetful of the
promises of their baptism; like the unhappy Pretexta
spoken of by our holy Bishop, who had her hands
suddenly withered and who died five months afterwards,
and was precipitated into hell because by
order of her husband she curled the hair of her niece
after a worldly fashion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reality Anne Barroy was a dull, narrow-minded
woman, desperately loyal to her convictions, yet with
sufficient cunning to know that her own claims to distinction
rested upon the pretensions of her charge to
superior sanctity; and these she determined to uphold
at all costs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They feast, those sinners, while that angel eats
only the food left by the servants, and that, too, after
it has become mouldy. She suffers from cold and
hears the mass with arms outstretched in the form of
a cross. What her reward will be we all know.
Their punishment I leave in the hands of God and
the saints.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A young Frenchman of noble family, who had
been sent out to Canada by his relations on a <span class='it'>lettre
de cachet</span>, was also a member of Jacques Le Ber’s
household. Louis de Thevet, Sieur d’Ordieux, had
lost his father and was in hopes of succeeding him as
<span class='it'>Lieutenant-Genéral des Eaux et des Forêts</span>, of the
Duchy of Valois, an hereditary office in the family.
His uncle and step-brothers induced him to sell it,
promising that the Duke de Gusore would give him
a lieutenancy in the infantry. The prospect failing
him, he was afterwards sent to Canada, where he
was left by his relatives entirely without resources.
An effort had been made to send him to Louisiana,
but he resolutely refused to serve as a private soldier,
because, as he maintained, he was of noble birth.
Backed by Le Ber’s powerful influence, he had contrived
so far successfully to elude all efforts to dispose
of him contrary to his own inclinations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The youth has great expectations, nor can his
uncle be expected to live forever. He may yet be a
great noble, powerful at Court. Those who befriend
him will lose nothing,” decided Le Ber.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII.</h1></div>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:.9em;'><span class='it'>A FOREST ADVENTURE.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HE Canadians, reduced to the last extremity by
the vacillating policy of the late Governor, Denonville,
had found in the Count de Frontenac a chief
whom they could trust. Frontenac, realizing that
prompt and bold action was necessary to sustain this
confidence, resolved to take the initiative, and revive
the prestige of the French arms by striking swift
blows. The wandering Iroquois appeared as evasive
as ghosts; but the English remained open to attack.
Rumors began to circulate through the settlement
that a war party was about to be organized. It was
noticed that arms and provisions were being quietly
collected. The women became anxious. The older
men discussed the question gravely; the younger
were wildly excited at the prospect of fighting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon it became known that three bands of picked
men were to start from Ville Marie, Three Rivers and
Quebec, respectively; the first to strike at Albany,
the second at the border settlements of New Hampshire,
and the third at those of Maine. The party
from Ville Marie was ready first. It consisted of two
hundred and ten men, of whom ninety-six were Christian
Iroquois from the two mission villages of Sault
St. Louis and the Mountain of Ville Marie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French were mostly coureurs de bois. These
restless spirits had shared in the general demoralization,
and under Denonville’s rule had proved unmanageable.
Their chief virtues were hardihood and
skill in woodcraft; their principal faults insubordination
and lawlessness. Tact and address were needed
in guiding them. The leaders of the present expedition,
thoroughly trained in the roving and adventurous
character of Indian warfare, enjoyed the entire confidence
of the hardy bushrangers. Le Moyne de St.
Helène and d’Ailleboust de Mantet had the first
command, supported by the brothers Le Moyne
d’Iberville and Le Moyne de Bienville, with Repentigny
de Montesson, Bonrepos, Le Ber du Chesne, and
many other scions of the sturdy Canadian nobility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was difficulty in finding sufficient provisions
for the expedition; but finally, by seeking from house
to house, getting here a few biscuits and there a flitch
of bacon, enough was collected to supply a considerable
party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They began their march in the depth of winter.
As they passed over the surface of the frozen St.
Lawrence, each man had the hood of his blanket-coat
drawn over his head and held a gun in his mittened
hand; a knife, a hatchet, a tobacco-pouch and a bag
for holding bullets hung at his belt; he bore a pack
on his shoulders, while his pipe, in a leather case, was
suspended at his neck. The blankets and provisions
of the expedition were conveyed on Indian sledges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Du Chesne was the gayest of the party, most of
whom appeared to regard this adventure more as a
frolic than a serious adventure. War was a pastime
to these young Canadian seigniors, as well as the
almost constant employment of their lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crossing the forest to Chambly, they advanced up
the frozen Richelieu towards Lake Champlain, for
more than a century the great thoroughfare of war
parties. The trees stood white as ghosts in the sheltered
hollows of the woods, or shivered bare and gray
on the wind-swept ridges. The Canadians made
their way on snowshoes, with bodies half bent, struggling
through frozen pine swamps, along deep ravines,
and under frowning hill-sides. Their snowshoes broke
on the hard crust or were shivered against rocks or the
trunks of fallen trees. The woods resounded with
jest and laughter as the gay bushrangers shouted at
seeing one another catch and trip to sprawl awkwardly
in the deep snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Helène, wishing to hold a council, ordered the
company to halt. Frontenac had left the precise point
of attack to the discretion of the Canadian leaders,
who were familiar with all the conditions of the
country through which they were passing, and the
men had been kept in ignorance of their destination.
The Indians had become distrustful, and now demanded
to know where they were being taken.
Fickle, wayward, and inconsequent as children, these
allies must at the same time be conciliated and controlled,
for it was impossible to do without their help.
There always existed serious danger that they might
repudiate the French alliance, join hands with the
English traders, make peace with the Iroquois, and
sacrifice their former friends without the slightest
compunction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are going to attack Albany,” d’Ailleboust de
Mantet said firmly. “We must reach that place or
die in the attempt. We must obey the orders of our
great father Onontio.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indians muttered angrily together. They declared
the French had surrendered through cowardice
the prisoners they had caught by treachery. The
palefaces had expected their allies to bear the brunt
of the war, and then left them to their fate. The
Iroquois had actually burnt French captives in their
towns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long is it since the French have grown so
bold?” shouted one in derision. “They have been
shut up in their forts. Will they now fight in the
light of day like men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall fight or die,” answered St. Helène
boldly. “Are our Indian allies squaws that they
should fly at the first approach of danger? Before
Onontio protected you you felt the teeth of the
ravenous Iroquois dog. Our Governor tamed him
and tied him up, but when Onontio was far away he
devoured you worse than ever. We are strong
enough to kill the English, destroy the Iroquois, and
whip you if you fail in your duty to us. Will you let
the English brandy that has killed you in your wigwams
lure you into the kettles of the Iroquois?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Christian chief of Sault St. Louis, known as
the “Great Mohawk,” harangued his followers, exhorting
them to wash out their wrongs in blood, but
the savages remained turbulent, and seemed to be
upon the point of deserting in a body. Their defection
would mean the failure of the enterprise. At
this juncture Le Ber du Chesne came to the rescue.
Persuasion having failed he tried the effects of taunts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are cowards!” he cried. “You do not know
what war is; go back to your women and children.
You never killed a man, and you never ate one
except those that were given you tied hand and foot.
Go home; we do not need your services.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Du Chesne gained his point. The pride of the
warriors was aroused, and for the moment they were
full of fight. The decision as to the point of attack
was postponed, however, and the expedition moved
on. When, after a march of eight days, they reached
the Hudson, and found the place where two paths
diverged, the one leading to Albany and the other to
Schenectady, they took the latter. All agreed that
an attack on Albany would be an act of desperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They bivouaced in the forest in squads of twelve or
more. Digging away the snow in a circle, they
covered the bare earth with a bed of spruce boughs,
made a fire in the centre and gathered around it to
smoke their pipes. Here crouched the Christian
savage muffled in his blanket, his unwashed face
bearing traces of the soot and vermilion he had
assumed for the war-dance in the square of the mission
village. There sat the Canadian, hooded like a
Capuchin monk, but irrepressible in loquacity. The
camp-fire glowed on their bronzed and animated
features and lighted up the rocks and pines behind
them. The silent woods beyond presented a region
of enchanted romance and mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their slender store of provisions having been almost
all consumed or shared with the Indians, Le Ber du
Chesne was detailed to head a reconnoitring expedition
of less than a score of men. Progress through
the snow-clogged woods was slow and painful; the
lengthening days had brought a partial thaw, and the
little band waded through the melting snow and the
mingled ice, mud and water of the gloomy swamps.
Lowering gray clouds stretched monotonously over
the desolate waste. Their provisions soon exhausted,
they boiled moccasins for food, or scraped away the
snow to find hickory and beech nuts. Fires could not
be lighted lest the smoke should betray their presence.
Many suffered from frost-bites, and the men soon
were half dead with cold, fatigue and hunger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weather changed. Pelted by a cold, gusty
snowstorm, they lost the track and toiled on, shaking
down at every step a shower of fleecy white from the
burdened branches. It seemed impossible either to
advance or retreat. Thoroughly discouraged, shivering
and famishing, it appeared as if nothing remained
but to lie down and die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would that I could see the little home, or that I
could at least have the blessing of a priest. It is ill
to die like a rat in a hole,” murmured le Canotier
drowsily, as he sank down on the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rouse thee, my fine big fellow!” shouted du
Chesne. “Rouse thee if thou wouldst again see Ville
Marie and Baboche and the little ones. I look to thee
to show the spirit of a man, and to uphold the spirits
of thy comrades.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is this, mon Capitaine?” suddenly exclaimed
le Canotier, starting up keenly alert, his
hand instinctively grasping his knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glancing over his shoulder du Chesne saw close
beside him a plumed and painted Indian, standing
motionless as a bronze statue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adarahta comes to his French brother as a
friend,” muttered the Indian in guttural accents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what would Adarahta?” demanded the
young Canadian, his keen eyes striving to read the
savage’s expressionless features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adarahta has been sent by the white chief to
seek his young brother, who he feared was lost in the
storm, to lead him to the spot where the French war-party
camps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you are not of our allies. You are an Iroquois,”
returned du Chesne, still distrustful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Adarahta, is a son of the Great Mohawk.
Taken captive by the Iroquois, treated as their slave,
he would pay the debt he owes to his enemies. Is
my French brother ready to follow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still du Chesne hesitated. This might be some
snare planned by the wily Indian to entrap them.
Their circumstances were desperate, and this offer
presented the possibility of escape. Action held a
relief from hopeless suffering. It might be better to
risk something than to perish miserably in the snow.
The Canadians, feeble and emaciated, found it almost
impossible to arouse themselves, but their leader
addressed them in terms so animating that they
caught his spirit and declared their readiness to push
on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We follow,” du Chesne decided. “Adarahta shall
walk before me. At the first sign of treachery I shall
shoot him like a wolf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indian made no response. He moved silently
in front, closely followed by the young commander,
while the weary bushrangers dragged themselves
through the drifts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the camp of our brothers far?” asked du
Chesne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Close at hand,” responded the guide, as his eyes
darted furtive glances in every direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would we were well out of this scrape. That
painted fox means us ill,” whispered le Canotier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had reached a narrow defile, the bed of a
frozen stream, guarded on either side by high banks
clothed with a labyrinth of bushes. Suddenly the
air was filled with whoops and yells as scores of
savages leaped from their hiding-places. As a rapid
fire opened from the thickets, Adarahta fell beneath a
death-blow from the leader of the expedition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Treachery! we are betrayed. Courage, my brave
fellows!” shouted du Chesne. “Better to die fighting
than to freeze in inaction. We shall sell our lives
dearly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So dense was the snowstorm that the Canadians
could not well distinguish their advancing foes from
those of their own party. The cries of the combatants
were redoubled by the echoes of the narrow
valley. In this moment of intense bewilderment the
Canadians became broken and confused. Du Chesne
ran to where the uproar was greatest, shouting, gesticulating,
encouraging his men. Then he was suddenly
plunged into a horror of thick darkness, and fell
unconscious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Le Ber du Chesne recovered his hold on life
he was lying in a wigwam attended by two squaws,
who were awaiting the return of a party of Iroquois.
The young Canadian alternately shivered and burned
in the fever occasioned by his wounds. The Indian
women were indifferently kind. They told him that
he was to be carried to a distant Iroquois village;
informing him also that the most of his party had
been killed—only a few had managed to escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man’s mind was still confused; fancy
and reality blended inextricably together. Dreadful
scenes of bloodshed, privation and misery mingled
with memories of mirth and pastime. His thoughts
travelled back to his home in Ville Marie. The
father, stern and reticent, whose affection this youngest
son had never doubted; the dead mother, whose
tender care had been so sadly missed; the sister
whose superior virtue he regarded with distant and
respectful reverence—his heart turned to them with
homesick yearning. Fancy dwelt most persistently
upon the dear companion of his childhood, Diane de
Monesthrol. He remembered her on her first arrival
from France, a weary, dejected little stranger. Nanon’s
sharp tongue had been quick to remind the boy of the
deference he owed to his father’s noble guests, but the
little French girl’s affection had obliterated all class
distinctions. What frolics and escapades they had
had together! Diane had shown herself a trusty
comrade, always ready to shield him, generously
sharing with him every benefit. Far away in Ville
Marie she would not forget to pray for him. This
conviction brought comfort to his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he began to recover strength du Chesne’s
natural buoyancy of temperament soon reasserted
itself. If he could become sufficiently strong to
travel before his enemies returned he could easily
make his escape. Each day his physical powers
improved, and he had arranged all the details of
flight when his hopes were abruptly crushed by the
arrival of the Iroquois.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indians carried numerous scalps, and brought
with them a number of prisoners. They vaunted
their own exploits, and had no hesitation in proclaiming
that there was nothing on earth so great as the
Iroquois League. Being in haste to reach their own
country they started at once, taking du Chesne with
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The journey westward along the Mohawk valley
was long and toilsome. They passed the first Mohawk
town, Kughuawaga, standing on a hill, encircled
by a strong palisade. Here the crowded dwellings of
bark were shaped like the arched coverings of huge
baggage waggons, and decorated with the tokens or
armorial bearings of their owners. Gandagora was
situated in a meadow. Tionondogue, the last and
strongest of these fortified villages, stood, like the
first, on a hill overlooking the river. On through the
dense columns of primeval forest they marched,
through swamps and brooks and gullies, until they
emerged from the shadows of the woods into the
broad light of an Indian clearing, where the town
of the Oneidas stood. This place contained about
one hundred bark dwellings, and numbered twice as
many warriors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still advancing, they came at length to a vast open
space where the rugged fields sloped upwards into a
broad, low hill crowned with the lodges of Onondaga.
In this capital of the Confederacy burned the council
fires of five tribes. Here in time of need were gathered
their wisest and best to debate questions of war
and policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a distance of some leagues they had been met
by a crowd of the inhabitants, among them a troop
of women bringing venison and corn, beaten together
in a pulp and boiled, to regale the triumphant
warriors. Here they halted and spent the night in
songs of victory, mingled with the dismal chants
of the prisoners, who were forced to dance for the
entertainment of their captors. The next day, as
they approached the town, the savage hive sent forth
its swarms to meet them, and they were greeted with
demonstrations of the wildest joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Du Chesne had visited many Indian villages. The
bronzed groups gathered around the blazing fires, the
flames of which painted each face in vivid light; the
shrivelled squaws, grisly warriors scarred by many
wounds, young braves whose honors were yet to be
won, brown damsels flaunting in beads and ochre, the
noisy children rollicking with restless dogs—all these
were familiar sights to him. He was sufficiently
intimate with their customs and prejudices to render
himself agreeable. The adaptable young Canadian
lost no opportunity of ingratiating himself. His good
humor, gay songs, and clever mimicry afforded his
hosts constant amusement. He knew these dusky
denizens of the forest far too well, however, to suppose
that his fate would be influenced by the favor in
which he was held. In this focus of untrained
savagery, ferocity was cultivated as a virtue, and
every soft emotion was stifled as unworthy of a man.
The son of the rich trader of Ville Marie, a youth
who had already made a name for himself in the
annals of Indian warfare, was far too rich a prize to
be willingly relinquished. By words and signs he
was constantly warned that his hour was come, and
each day with renewed astonishment he found himself
still among the living. Yet life contained many
chances; any moment might bring opportunity of
escape. So du Chesne betrayed no sign of trepidation,
but jested as merrily as though he were safe
within the precincts of Ville Marie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been decided that the prisoners should be
distributed among the different towns of the Confederacy;
only a young French lad named Gervais Bluet
remained with du Chesne. As a preliminary torment
an old chief tried to burn the captive’s finger in the
bowl of his pipe. This was too much for the Canadian’s
philosophy, and without wasting words on the
matter he knocked his assailant down. A murmur of
approval arose from the spectators. If du Chesne
had begged for mercy their hearts would have been
hard as stone, but this proof of courage pleased the
warrior throng. He even contrived to make friends
among the savages, the most powerful of whom was
the famous Onondaga orator, Otréouate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you destroy the wasp’s nest you must crush the
wasps or they will sting you,” declared the old man,
fixing his gaze reflectively on a great mask with teeth
and eyes of brass before which the Iroquois performed
their conjurations. “When our young men have
sung the war-song they will listen only to the sound
of their own fury. I would gladly save you, but it is
not in my power to do so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what will be the manner of my death?” the
prisoner asked coolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will run the gauntlet. It has been decided
that the young white chief shall furnish entertainment
for the women and children. After that you will be
devoured by fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well,” responded the young man quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That day he gave his farewell feast, after the
custom of those who know themselves to be at the
point of death. When the company had gathered
the condemned man addressed them in a clear voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brothers, I am about to die. Onontio’s arm
is long, and he will certainly avenge his children.
That concerns you, not me. Do your worst; you
cannot make me shrink. I do not fear torture or
death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night the white prisoners were closely
watched. Two Indians slept one on either side of
them, another being stretched across the door of the
lodge. Du Chesne had formed no plan, he could
depend upon no hope of reprieve, yet never did he
entirely lose heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next evening the captives were led out amidst
the shouts of the women and children. The village
was all alive with the bustle of preparation. The
young white chief would furnish ample entertainment.
The Iroquois formed themselves into long double
lines, armed with clubs, thorny stocks, or slender iron
rods bought from the Dutchmen on the Hudson.
The prisoners were started to run between the two
lines. They were saluted with yells and a tempest of
blows. Bruised and lacerated from head to foot, and
streaming with blood, young Bluet fell senseless to
the ground. At the sight a sort of frenzy took
possession of du Chesne. Seizing a club from one of
the assailants, he used it with such vigor that his persecutors
fell right and left beneath his blows. It was
a valor born of sheer desperation, but it served him
well. In their amazement the Iroquois became confused,
and in the excitement du Chesne darted
through an opening in the lines, and seeking shelter
behind a wood-pile, found beneath it a hole into
which he contrived to creep, and which afforded
temporary concealment. A howl of furious consternation
arose from the Indians. The prisoner had
suddenly vanished. They ranged fields and forests
in vain pursuit, and then concluded that their captive
was a sorcerer who had been delivered by his
Manitou.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From his place of hiding in the deepening darkness
du Chesne could see much of what was going on
around him. Once a tall savage passed so near that
he could have touched him with his hand. The fate
that awaited him if he were discovered, and the
scarcely less terrible dangers of the wilderness that
lay between him and his home, filled him with
despair. Spent and exhausted he lay through the
night in his cramped hiding-place, creeping out once
to grope for a few ears of corn left from the last year’s
harvest. He wisely judged that his safety lay in
remaining there till the savages out in search of him
should return. So, though cramped and stiffened, he
lay beneath the wood-pile till the following night;
then when all was still, he slipped out, and had reached
the outskirts of the village when, to his dismay,
he stumbled over a log of wood. A sentinel immediately
gave the alarm and the whole village started in
furious pursuit. Du Chesne had been the fleetest
runner among all his companions. He now had the
advantage of a start and kept in advance of his pursuers,
who took up the chase like hounds seeking
game. When daylight came he showed himself from
time to time to lure them on, then yelled defiance and
distanced them again. At night all but two had
given up the chase. Seeing a hollow tree, du Chesne
crept into it, while the Iroquois, losing the trace in
the dark, lay down to sleep near by. At midnight
he emerged from his retreat, brained his enemies
with a club, and continued his journey in triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Du Chesne directed his course by the sun, and for
food dug roots or peeled the soft inner bark off the
trees; sometimes he succeeded in catching tortoises
in muddy brooks. He had the good fortune to find
a hatchet in a deserted camp and with it made one of
those wooden implements which the Indians used for
kindling fire by friction. This saved him from his
worst suffering, as he had but little covering and was
at night exposed to tortures from cold. Building a
fire in some deep nook of the forest he warmed himself,
cooked the food he had found, and slept till daybreak,
taking the precaution to throw water on the
embers lest the rising smoke should attract attention.
Through all hope beckoned him on. Life held so
many prizes, offered so many delights, that at no
time could he give way to despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once he found himself near a band of Iroquois
hunters, but he lay concealed, and they passed without
perceiving him. Du Chesne followed their trail
back, and found a bark canoe which they had hidden
near the banks of the river. It was too large for his
use, but he reduced it to convenient size, embarked
and descended the stream. After that progress was
comparatively easy. Finally, after enduring many
hardships, he reached Ville Marie, where he was welcomed
as one restored from the dead—the main expedition
having, on returning from its successful
attack on Schenectady, reported his capture by the
Iroquois, from whom no mercy could be expected.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:.9em;'><span class='it'>VILLE MARIE</span>.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>B</span>EAUTIFULLY situated as it was between
Mount Royal and the St. Lawrence, at that
early date Ville Marie could scarcely be termed imposing
in appearance. It was busy and bustling, and
had been described as “a place which makes so much
noise, but is of so little account.” A frontier town at
the head of the colony, it was the natural resort of
desperadoes of every description, offering a singular
contrast between the rigor of its clerical seigniors and
the riotous license of the wild crews which invaded it.
Its citizens were mostly disbanded soldiers, traders
and coureurs de bois—a turbulent population, whose
control taxed to the utmost the patience, tact and
ingenuity of the priestly governors. While a portion
of the residents were given up to practices of mystical
piety, others gambled, drank and stole; if hard
pressed by justice they had only to cross the river
and place themselves beyond seigniorial jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Limited as was the sphere of action, here existence
offered many striking contrasts. In love with an exquisite
ideal, men and women struggled to attain
purity and unselfishness: they nursed the sick, fed
the hungry, loved and forgave, lived in godly fear
and died fortified by eternal hope; and this side by
side with those who yielded themselves up with boundless
license to the worse passions of the human heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While scarcely more than a village in dimensions,
the preponderance of large buildings, churches and
convents imparted to the town a substantial appearance
which the number of the population and its
scanty resources scarcely warranted. Quaint steeples
and turrets cut the misty pallor of the sky. Ville
Marie wore an aspect half military, half monastic. At
sunrise and sunset a squad of soldiers paraded in
front of the citadel; at night patrols marched through
the streets; church bells, deep and sweet mouthed,
rang out the Angelus morning, noon and night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the river-front were numerous taverns, in front
of which boats and canoes were drawn up on the
shore. Here voyageurs swaggered and swore, and
Indians, whom what Charlevois quaintly terms “a
light tinge of Christianity” had scarcely redeemed
from savagery, squatted in sullen apathy or quarrelled
with brutal ferocity. A row of small compact
dwellings extended along a narrow street then, as
now, called St. Paul. Some of the houses were of
stone, but the majority were of wood with stone
gables, as required by law, the roofs covered with
shingles. All outlying houses were pierced with
loopholes and fortified as well as the slender means
of their owners would permit. Gardens were mostly
fenced by pointed cedar stakes, with the poles firmly
tied together. Fields studded with scarred and
blackened stumps stretched away to the bordering
forest, crowding gloomy and silent on the right side
and on the left. The green shaggy back of the Mountain
towered over all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crowning the hill on the right stood the Seignior’s
windmill, built of rough stone, and pierced with loopholes
to serve in time of need as a place of defence.
This mill had a right to claim one-third of the grain
brought to be ground; of which portion the miller
received one-third as his share, and the Seminary required
that the inhabitants should have all their corn
ground there, or at one of the other mills owned by
the priests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toward the left, on an artificial elevation, at an
angle formed by the junction of a swift-glancing
rivulet with the St. Lawrence, was a square-bastioned
stone fort. This was the citadel of Ville Marie.
About 1640, M. d’Ailleboust had removed the palisade
of stakes which had formerly protected it, and had
fortified it by two bastions. The fort was provided
with artillery, and here, in command of a portion of
the Carignan-Salière regiment, resided the military
governor appointed by the Seminary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Overlooking the river appeared the church of Notre
Dame de Bonsecours, whose walls of rough grey
stone have shone as a symbol of hope to the yearning
eyes of many a weary voyageur, many a travel-worn
emigrant. Above the entrance stood a statue of the
Virgin, below which ran the inscription:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>“Si l’amour de Marie</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Dans ton cœur est gravé,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>En passant ne t’oublie</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>De lui dire un avé.”</span></p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Hotel-Dieu, founded in 1644 by Madame de
Bouillon, fronting on both St. Paul and St. Joseph
(now St. Sulpice) streets, was an abode of much
charity, tender devotion and heroic self-abnegation.
The nuns, a devoted sisterhood, nobly conspicuous
in the annals of the colony, excelled in acts of
kindness which had become sacramental symbols
of faithful obedience to God and loving brotherhood
with man. Under their snow-white wimples
beat hearts as brave as ever stirred under the robe of
statesman or gorget of soldier. The church stood on
St. Paul street, and was of stone in Tuscan style, surmounted
by a triangular pediment and cross. The
buildings consisted of hospital, convent and church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a gently swelling knoll west of the citadel stood
the edifice erected by M. Charon as a hospital. Farther
back, to the left, was the Jesuit church, fronting
on Notre Dame street. Adjoining this was the
College, a very small structure with large and carefully
cultivated gardens attached. The buildings of
the Congregation of Notre Dame faced on St. Paul
street, while the back windows overlooked the river;
they were surrounded by a high stone wall. Here
Marguerite Bourgeois, assisted by a band of noble
women, labored for the conversion of the savages, and
here the young girls of Ville Marie received all the
instruction they were likely to obtain. Back of the
settlement ran from the citadel a rough country road,
which is now Notre Dame street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fronting the river on the line of the street were the
enclosures and buildings of the Seminary, fortified, as
was the Hotel-Dieu, to resist the attacks of the Iroquois.
The ancient edifice was of the same shape as
the present, forming three sides of a square, surrounded
by spacious grounds. The priests’ gardens
were already renowned for the delicious quality of
their fruit. The air of thrift and comfort which
characterized the belongings of the clergy presented
a painful contrast to the extreme penury of the colonists.
With them, method, industry and frugality
had resulted in abounding prosperity. The parish
church of Notre Dame was directly in the centre of
Notre Dame street. It was a low edifice, built of
rough stone, pointed with mortar; the high-pitched
roof, covered with tin, reflecting the sunshine in
dazzling brightness. The principal entrance was at
the south end, and on the south-west corner was a
tower, surmounted by a belfry. The public market
was near the river, directly facing the Seminary property.
This was a favorite rendezvous for all loiterers,
as were also the public wells, which, to suit the
general convenience, had been placed near the Seminary,
at the market-place, and in the Jesuits’ garden.
Here the citizens gathered. The women enjoyed the
opportunities of gossiping at the well, their tongues
moving as swiftly as the running water, their whole
bodies aiding with an endless variety of appropriate
gestures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men, with a vivacity that never diminished,
held choleric arguments, or repeated marvellous
stories. They tapped their foreheads, clasped their
hands, clutched impetuously at perruques that presented
a wonderful impunity from becoming disarranged.
They discussed how Jean Louis had
strained his right arm and fallen under the power of
a sorcerer; how the good St. Anne had rescued
Pierre Boulot and his comrade from shipwreck because
they had made a vow in her honor; how Mère
Bouillette had been tormented by the lutin in the
shape of a will-o’-the-wisp, and the good Mère Berbier,
of the Congregation of Notre Dame, had presented
Madelon with a scapulaire as a charm against
fever. It was whispered that it was feared that
Georgeon and his fifty wolves, invisible when hunted
by honest men, were driving the colts about at night.
With bated breath they spoke of the dreaded scourge,
the Iroquois, and then, with tears still glistening in
their eyes, they broke into merry laughter at some
careless jest. The rigor of the climate prevented
much indulgence in that pleasant outdoor life in
which the French peasant delights, but as soon as the
late northern spring broke forth, and the air became
soft and balmy, the natural instincts reasserted themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the east of the town, where Viger Square now
stands, stretched a swampy marsh where the bulrushes
raised their tall heads and the stately purple iris
bloomed in profusion; there the long-drawn plaintive
cry of the water-fowl echoed through the stillness in
melancholy cadences. Back of the settlement, parallel
with Notre Dame street, a stream with mimic
rush and roar urged its way to the river. Between
this and the street, removed from the noise and bustle,
lay the quiet cemetery. Some distance away, to the
left, nestling at the foot of the mountain, was situated
the Mission village established by St. Sulpice for the
Christianized Indians. It was dominated by two
round stone towers, which afforded considerable protection
to the colony; a few French soldiers were
always stationed here. Near at hand, in winter half
buried in peaked drifts and massive banks of snow,
was the shrine of Notre Dame des Nièges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Opposite the city, on the south bank of the St.
Lawrence, extending from Longueuil to Laprairie, lay
the fief acquired by that brave colonist Charles Le
Moyne, the brother-in-law of Jacques Le Ber. His
son, the Baron de Longueuil, notwithstanding the
conditions of painful change and fluctuation that attended
the fortunes of the colony, reigned like a feudal
noble at Longueuil. His stone fort, flanked by four
strong towers, resembled a fortified French chateau.
A church and various substantial stone buildings clustered
around it. On St. Helen’s lovely isle, rising
with gently wooded slopes out of the water, the troops
often camped. Opposite La Salle’s Seigniory at La
Chine, on the south bank, was Sault St. Louis (Caughnawaga),
an Indian mission station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ville Marie was open to attack on all sides. The
town had been recently fortified with palisades. The
few defences it possessed were in very indifferent condition.
The country around, and for nearly a hundred
miles below it, was easily accessible to the Iroquois
by the routes of Lake Champlain and the Upper St.
Lawrence. In the unsettled and variable condition
of the colony, the clerical influence maintained a
certain solidity of aim to the community which they
had originated, and in which they certainly were the
ruling influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Christian outpost established in the wilderness,
ravaged by foes, feeble from the exhaustion of a
starved and persecuted infancy, Ville Marie still
contrived to exist.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Amid all the conflicting elements of her new
surroundings, Lydia Longloy contrived dexterously
to steer her way. In her old home she had
been taught to regard the French as “bloodthirsty
heathen,” but with easy adaptability and admirable
tact she now showed herself quite as ready to adopt
the faith and opinions of these new friends as she was
to follow their fashions and manners. A beguiling
innocence was her chief characteristic, accompanied
as it was by a soft amiability and teachableness both
touching and flattering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Père de Mereil, of the Seminary, who spoke the
English language and devoted himself especially to
the conversion of heretics, declared enthusiastically
that this young girl was the most interesting convert
he had ever been privileged to instruct. If the English
captive were occasionally betrayed into frivolity
by the levity of youth, the worthy priest ascribed
these lapses entirely to the worldly influence of
Mademoiselle de Monesthrol. Lydia had an easy
way of explaining herself to be always in the right,
and it would be unjust to attribute the pretty creature’s
innocent vanity and frank simplicity to other
than natural childish frailty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heedlessly generous with the divine faith of youth,
Diane de Monesthrol gave her love to the stranger.
During the long illness which followed Lydia’s removal
to Ville Marie, Diane nursed her with tender
care, and in her helplessness she had twined herself
around the closest fibres of Diane’s heart. She might
not be either very strong or very wise, but she was
her own pet, the joint protégé of herself and du
Chesne. Lydia’s trials and sufferings invested her
with a halo of romantic interest. Diane’s own glowing
imagination conferred upon the Puritan maiden
qualities of which the stranger had formed no conception.
Her pure and simple beauty would have
shone alike at a cottage door and in the halls of
princes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia rejoiced in the sweet and exhilarating consciousness
of an approving Providence. She found
herself placed exactly to her taste. Dreading pain,
she was only too well pleased to be allowed to
forget the past; finding herself flattered and caressed,
she desired nothing better than to enjoy the present.
An orphan, thrown upon the charity of
distant and reluctant relatives, her life had not been
happy. She had no enthusiasm, no imagination, no
warm human sympathy to render the severe existence
of her childhood endurable. Without in the least
realizing it, Lydia had been bored to extinction. She
hated now to think of those long, unlovely years of
repression of her natural faculties. She had been
accustomed to be looked down upon by her thrifty
England kindred, who had felt no hesitation in
sharply chiding her shortcomings. There her beauty
had been of small account; she had no chance of
wearing beautiful clothes, and had never listened to
the sweet accents of flattery. Her various misdeeds
had been severely visited upon her, her frailties
exposed to open scorn, with the cheerful prospect
held over her that in another existence these trifling
vanities should be still more actively rued in fire and
brimstone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thinking of all this Lydia Longloy rejoiced in her
new freedom with the whole strength of her trivial
soul. The Puritan settlement of Grotton, near Boston,
with its memories of friends and neighbors, its
precise restraint and rigid formality, became merely
an unpleasant remembrance to be crushed out of
sight. All the strict discipline of her New England
training fell from her like a cast-off garment. She
learned French with rapidity, absorbing the ideas and
sentiments of those among whom her lot was cast.
She adopted powder and patches, fans and feathers,
as though to the manner born. She acquired a
deliciously arch imitation of the Marquise’s airs;
and if she missed Diane’s dainty grace, her coquetry
had a touch of sweet naturalness as of a child’s
affectation and extravagance. Once she found that
to be pious was considered essential, thereafter her
piety satisfied even Anne Barroy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the large, hospitable household one more or less
made very little difference. Le Ber smiled indulgently
upon what he considered his ward’s new caprice, but
for him the English prisoner had no charms. There
were two whose favor she never succeeded in winning:
these were Madame de Monesthrol and Nanon,
who quickly arrived at a very distinct perception of
the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plebeian to the core,” Madame nodded her stately
head sagaciously, smelling at her <span class='it'>flacon</span> as if to keep
off infection. “The little one waters a barren field.
All that will count for nothing. This English girl
will keep all she can get, and she is clever at getting.
Yet one is young but once—can one blame her
faith?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nanon was still more outspoken in her opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah! that crocodile blonde demoiselle. There
are two words to a bargain, and our demoiselle will
always be a loser, for she is of those who give lavishly
with both hands; this other is a sponge who absorbs
all and yields nothing in return.”</p>

fur trade, and for nearly three years the Iroquois,
with malicious ingenuity, had contrived to
block up the main artery of commerce, the river
Ottawa, thus stopping the flow of the country’s life-blood.
The annual supply of beaver-skins cut off,
the settlement was compelled to exist upon credit.
During the preceding winter the need had been so
great that the authorities were obliged to distribute
the soldiers among the inhabitants to be fed. Canada
had been reduced to the last extremity, her merchants
and farmers were dying of hunger. But relief was at
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, shortly before the annual fair, a messenger
came in hot haste with the startling information
that Lake St. Louis was covered with canoes.
It must be an Iroquois invasion, and if so it was not
an impossibility that the whole community might be
destroyed. Cannon were fired to call in the troops
from the detached posts, the churches were thronged
by excited women and children, and the steady
march of trained soldiers resounded through the
streets. The authorities meanwhile were engaged in
anxious consultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly alarm was changed into frantic joy by
the arrival of a second scout, announcing that the
new comers were not enemies but friends, who instead
of destruction had come to bring good fortune
to Ville Marie. Frontenac’s courage and policy had
at length succeeded in accomplishing the difficult but
absolutely indispensable task of opening the Ottawa.
Louvigny and Perrot, the envoys sent to the Indians
by the Governor in the spring, whose persuasions had
been supplemented by the news of the late victory
gained on the Ottawa and the capture of Schenectady,
had executed their mission satisfactorily. Despoiled
of an English market for their furs, the savages
were willing to seek sale for them among the French.
Two hundred canoes had come laden with the coveted
articles of merchandise which had for so long been
accumulating at Michillimackinac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed as though good fortune, like ill-luck,
were not to come alone. While three years of
arrested sustenance came down from the great lakes
of the West, a French fleet, freighted with soldiers
and supplies, sailed up the St. Lawrence. This sight
at any time was a reason for rejoicing. It meant
news from home, succor from want, encouragement,
relief. A moment had changed mourning apprehension
into the ease and composure of perfect security.
Almost dizzy with the sweetness of relief, struggling
to retain sober consciousness, men cheered and
laughed, while women who had worn a brave smile
during the day of trouble now wept hysterically. As
they looked into each other’s eyes, the colonists
realized how terrible had been the strain through
which they had passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they drew near, the savages, ever delighting in
noise, fired their guns, while the deep continuous roar
of cannon from the citadel greeted them as they
landed before the town—woods, waves and hills resounding
with the thunder of artillery. A great quantity
of evergreen boughs was gathered for the use of
the Indians, and of these they hastily constructed
their wigwams outside the palisades. The Governor-General
had come up from Quebec to meet the
Indian allies. These negotiations, political and commercial,
were of the utmost importance to the settlement;
there was scarcely an individual in all the
colony who was not keenly interested both in the
Council which was now to be held and in the great
fair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moved by the universal impulse, Diane and Lydia,
attended by Le Ber du Chesne, the Chevalier de
Crisasi, and the Sieur d’Ordieux, started to attend the
Council meeting. Nanon, thoroughly enjoying the
occasion, walked behind. Nothing escaped the notice
of her quick eyes or the comment of her unruly
tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well said that good blood never lies. Our
little partridge holds her own with the best; those
who have taste turn their heads to look at her. Well
they may; a great lady is not a sight to be met with
every day in this part of the world, where every
trader’s wife and daughter would like to perk their
heads with their betters. It is an <span class='it'>officier bleu</span>, no less,
or some great noble at the King’s court, who should
claim our demoiselle as his bride, and think himself
lucky to get her besides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane’s gown of heavy coffee-colored brocade had
a train which swayed gently behind, not dragging,
but caught up gracefully and drawn through both
pocket holes, displaying the laced skirt and the pretty
shoes on which jewelled buckles glittered. Her corsage
was long waisted and close fitting; clouds of
lace hung from the sleeves, while a lace fichu was
crossed over the bosom and fastened by some fragrant
crimson roses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On either side of Mademoiselle de Monesthrol
walked the Chevalier and the Sieur d’Ordieux. The
first was a remarkably elegant and distinguished-looking
man. The thin dark face set within its
frame of powdered hair was somewhat languid and
supercilious; the melancholy eyes were almost oriental
in their depth and intensity of expression.
The Marquis de Crisasi and his brother, the Chevalier,
were Sicilian noblemen who had compromised
themselves by taking the part of France against
Spain. Their immense possessions were confiscated,
and by a sudden turn of fortune’s wheel they had
been precipitated from the highest pinnacle of prosperity
down to bitter adversity. They had been
sent out to Canada in command of French troops.
The favor proved, in this case as in many others, a
most unreliable dependence. The Marquis had been
appointed Governor of Three Rivers, a poor post,
where it was almost impossible to keep from starving.
The Chevalier, who was regarded by his contemporaries
as a model of every knightly virtue and accomplishment,
neglected and forsaken by his friends at
the Court, waited for those marks of royal favor
which he was never to receive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For M. le Chevalier, his day is past,” decided Le
Ber promptly; “those who are cast off by the Court
have no future.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Chevalier was one of Madame de Monesthrol’s
warmest personal friends, valued by her for his
high breeding and personal worth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sieur d’Ordieux was a little man who, in the
desire to increase his stature, used such high heels
that he seemed to be walking upon stilts. He wore a
long black wig, powdered and curled in front. He
was always decked in finery like a woman, steeped in
perfumes, glittering with jewelry and ornamented with
fluttering ribbons. This youth was a common type
of the men who strolled in the gardens of the
Tuilleries or in the galleries of Versailles, pulling the
strings which set the cardboard toys—the <span class='it'>pantins</span>—in
motion; embroidering at women’s frames in women’s
salons; gambling away body and soul at the receptions
given by great Court ladies, or fighting bloody
duels at Longchamps on account of frail Court
beauties. Many of these men were driven by misfortune
or their own reckless folly to the New World.
When receiving their baptism of fire the high heads
were dauntless and dignified; these reckless triflers,
when brought into contact with real conditions and
necessities, proved themselves equal to the occasion—the
most graceless young spendthrifts often showing
themselves to be brave soldiers and gallant gentlemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just now the Sieur d’Ordieux certainly could not
be considered interesting. His conversation related
exclusively to his own interests and exploits—the
Court, the injuries and indignities which his relatives
had inflicted upon him, the grandeur of his expectations.
The Chevalier walked in dignified silence.
His doleful glances inspired Diane with a teasing
wish to coax and torment. She was young, thirsting
for some deep emotion, moved by swaying currents of
feeling of whose origin she had formed no conception.
Consequently her smiles encouraged the loquacious
youth, whose vanity never at any time required
stimulant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Miséricord!</span>—but they are fools, these men,”
soliloquized Nanon, who appreciated the humor of the
situation. “This little turkey believes that the world
is created for him and his brood to strut and crow in.
That poor, good, jealous Chevalier has grown as thin
as a nail, and makes such sighs. He is furiously displeased,
that one, and he never guesses it is for the
grocer’s son that our demoiselle plays the coquette.
<span class='it'>Comment!</span> but it is inconceivable that the Sieur du
Chesne perceives nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Du Chesne’s handsome young face was shaded by
a large musquetaire hat of felt in which a freshly
curled white plume waved gaily. He wore a new
crimson coat, bordered with a gold band in a fashion
called at that time <span class='it'>à la bourgogne</span>. Black silk stockings
displayed the perfect symmetry of his limbs. It
was a costume not unworthy a young man’s vanity.
De Crisasi and d’Ordieux both wore swords which
clanked at every step. The knowledge that his
favorite son was without one cost Le Ber many a
poignant pang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia walked demurely at du Chesne’s side. Her
fresh face, tinged with excited color, stood out in
bewildering contrast to the flaxen hair. The neat
dress of dark camlet with its snowy frills and
“pinners,” which had formed her Puritan costume, had
been exchanged for an imitation of Diane’s dress.
Mademoiselle de Monesthrol delighted in decking out
her protégé in the best she had; nothing was too
good to heighten the charm of the blonde beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is likely to be an expensive whim,” Madame
had remarked to Le Ber. “It would have been
better, my friend, to have provided Diane with the
little negro boy of whom you have so often spoken.
The imp would have been less mischievous than this
colorless English girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Le Ber shook his head. Though a Frenchman he
was a man of few words. Many critical issues had
been confided to his judgment with advantageous
results. Was it possible that a frail, silly girl should
have power to thwart the plans which he had labored
with a refinement of elaboration to perfect?</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they neared the encampment Lydia gave a
frightened start. “I dread the savages. The very
glance of these painted monsters makes me faint and
ill,” she whispered nervously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane paused with quick compunction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I who should have thought of that. You
have nothing to fear, little one, with du Chesne at
your side. Leave her not, even for an instant, my
friend. Remember the terrible trial through which
she has passed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia reddened to her very throat, and turning
around flashed upon the young man such an odd,
piteous, pleading glance that it startled him. Her
naivété was as novel as her beauty; every glance had
a glamor of magic. She was attractive with that
undefinable charm that belongs to some women, a
magnetic quality not depending upon faultlessness of
physical beauty. A very child, she carried herself
with an air of innocently transparent indifference,
with her ready blushes and her pettish, winning face.
She was so petulant that du Chesne was amused, and
found his charge extremely interesting. When, some
time later, Diane, finding herself at his side, whispered
words of thanks for his consideration, he shook his
head in protest, laughing in a startled, gratified sort of
way; then turned from the subject with the careless
ease which was one of his characteristics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is to you she owes her life. I want you really
to like her, du Chesne,” the girl pleaded warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would not be difficult to do that!” and du
Chesne laughed again.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span><h1>CHAPTER X.</h1></div>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:.9em;'><span class='it'>THE COUNCIL.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>A</span> LARGE oblong space was marked out on a
common between St. Paul street and the river,
and enclosed by a fence of branches. In this enclosure
the Council upon which such momentous issues
depended was held. Some of the Indians who
attended had gathered from a distance of fully two
thousand miles. The assembly presented a strange
and grotesque appearance. There were Hurons and
Ottawas from Michillimackinac; Pottawatomies from
Lake Michigan; Ojibways from Lake Superior;
Crees from the remote north; Mascoutins, Sacs,
Foxes, Winnebagoes and Menominies from Wisconsin;
Miamis from St. Joseph; Illinois from River
Illinois; Abenakis from Acadia, and many allied
tribes of less account. These sang, whooped and
harangued in their several accents. Their features
were different; so were their manners, their weapons,
their decorations, their dances. Each savage was
painted in diverse hues and patterns, and each appeared
in his dress of ceremony—leather shirt fringed
with scalp-locks, colored blanket, robe of bison-hide
or beaver-skin, bristling crest of hair or long lank
tresses, eagle feathers or skins of beasts. A young
Algonquin warrior, in the dress of a Canadian, was
crowned with drooping scarlet feathers and a tall
ridge of hair like a cock’s crest. A chief of the
Foxes, whose face was painted red, wore an elaborate
French wig, the abundant curls of which were in a
state of complete entanglement. He persisted in
bowing right and left with great affability, lifting his
wig like a hat to show that he was perfect in French
politeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indians, feathered, greased and painted, were
seated in close ranks on the grass, braves, chiefs
and sachems gravely smoking their pipes in silence.
Troops, making the best possible show, were drawn
up in lines along the sides. At one side, under a
canopy of boughs and leaves, were seats for the spectators;
these were occupied by ladies, officials, and
the principal citizens of Ville Marie. In front was
placed a chair for the Governor-General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French yielded themselves up readily to the
spirit of the occasion. The whole community had
recently passed through unheard-of sufferings, yet on
the appearance of the faintest gleam of sunshine the
colonists were ready to smile, to deck themselves out
in their bravest, to seize eagerly all the brightness of
the hour. Eyes and jewels flashed, brocades rustled,
feathers waved, and here and there was a shimmer of
filmy lace. In carf and coif, ladies whose noble manners,
stately bearing and sparkling wit would have
fitly graced the Court of Versailles, whose elegant
and ingenious coquetries were the product of the
most finished civilization, promenaded, escorted by
officers bedecked with gold and silver lace and all
the martial foppery rendered necessary by the etiquette
of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vive M. le Comte de Frontenac! It is M. le
Gouverneur who has saved us from the clutches of
those vultures, the Iroquois! Yes, and opened the
fur trade, that we may not starve! Vive le Gouverneur!”
shouted the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frontenac’s gallantry and open-handed liberality,
his success in dealing with the Indians, the prosperity
which his policy had brought to Canada, rendered
him the idol of the populace, who had not been
blinded by jealousy or rent by internal divisions, as
were the officials, civil, military and ecclesiastical, all
of whom apparently wanted to obtain aid from the
Government. In the upper classes every man had a
grievance against somebody or something, of which
he was continually writing complaints to France.
These bickerings and animosities added, at least, a
spice of variety to the life of the colony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A detachment of guards in the King’s livery preceded
the Governor, who was surrounded by a
brilliant retinue of young nobles, gorgeous in lace
and ribbons. Louis de Buade, Comte de Frontenac,
Chevalier de l’Ordre de St. Louis and Governor-General
of New France, had already attained his
seventieth year, though the alert, decided movements
of the bold and impetuous soldier showed no diminution
of vitality. He represented the best type of
French courtier and gentleman soldier of the reign of
<span class='it'>le Grand Monarque</span>. A fine martial figure, erect and
vigorous, the natural distinction of his mien and pose,
the assured ease of look and manner, marked him as
one familiar with the usages of courts. His keen
black eyes shone beneath a broad brow upon which
the years, with their many troubles, had traced
scarcely a wrinkle. The Roman nose, thin lips, and
firm, prominent chin, imparted a severe and imperious
expression to his face. He wore a wig, lightly powdered,
with long ringlets falling on either side of his
face, crowned by a three-cornered hat bordered with
gold. His fine red surtout and short embroidered
vest were of the latest fashion; his loosely knotted
cravat was of point lace, while his white and delicate
hands were partly concealed by falling ruffles of the
same. He wore shoulder and sword knots. A broad
belt, inlaid with gold, fell from his right shoulder,
encircling the waist, and held a sword whose hilt,
resting upon the left hip, glittered with jewels. His
shapely limbs showed to advantage in long black silk
stockings and shoes with jewelled buckles. The Governor
had a decided taste for splendor and profusion,
delighting in brilliancy of clothing and luxury of
service. All his surroundings presented as much
pomp and magnificence as the slender resources of
the colony would permit. This was an hour of
triumph precious to the daring and potent spirit of
the French noble, who fully perceived the force of his
own position. Some time before he had been recalled
in disgrace owing to the machinations of his enemies,
and during his absence the colony’s fortunes had
fallen to their very lowest ebb; he had now returned
to taste the sweetness of success, and even his foes
were forced to acknowledge the beneficial results
which his policy had already achieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the Governor stood the interpreters, whose
services were constantly required, while scattered
about were a number of Canadian officers nearly
every man of whom had been the hero of some marvellous
exploit. Here was the Chevalier de Callière,
Governor of Ville Marie, dark and haughty, almost as
imperious as Frontenac himself, a man respected by
the savages and adored by his own men. His rival,
de Vaudreuil, a fluent, voluble Gascon, was in attendance
upon the beautiful Louise de Joybert of Quebec,
who was soon to become his bride, and had little
attention to give to the animated conversation of
d’Ailleboust de Mousseaux, Civil and Criminal Magistrate
of Ville Marie, and his brother d’Ailleboust de
Mantet, who had won laurels at the taking of Schenectady.
All three courteously saluted Boisberthelot
de Becancourt and Augustin le Gardeur de Coutremanche
as they passed. Leaning on his sword stood
the Sieur d’Hertel, who at the head of fifty Canadians
and savages had taken Salmon Falls during the
winter of 1690. Near by, Boucher de Boucherville,
who with forty-six Frenchmen had held the fort of
Three Rivers against five hundred Iroquois, was
holding animated discussion with the Sieur de
Montigny, whose body bore traces of conflict in innumerable
wounds, and who in command of only
twelve Canadians had taken forcible possession of
Portugal Cove, and with M. de Pontneuf, son of
the Baron de Becancourt, the preceding winter had
gallantly silenced the eight cannon defending Casco.
On one side the Sieurs de Beaujeu, de St. Ours, Baby
de Rainville, de Lanandière, Deschambault, Chartier
de Lobinière, d’Estimanville, de la Brossee, Repentigny
de Montesson, Captains Subercase, d’Orvilliers, Sieur
de Valrennes, and his lieutenant, M. Dupuy, conversed
with something emphatically Gallic in their
vivacious gestures and absorbed faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clergy were also well represented. Talking to
the Marquise de Monesthrol appeared Dollier de
Casson, Superior of the Seminary, gigantic in stature,
hearty of voice, with bold, brown, earnest face, frank
and simple in expression. He had been a cavalry
officer, and had fought bravely under Turenne; the
soldier and the gentleman still lived under the priest’s
hassock. Father Joseph Denys, Superior of the
Recollets, benign and jovial, basking openly in the
Governor’s favor, eyed jealously askance by the
Jesuits, stood close behind Frontenac. Father
Denys had to a great extent shared the Governor-General’s
disgrace; the period of Frontenac’s banishment
had proved evil days for the Recollets, and
their Superior would have been more than human had
he not exulted in their present exaltation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a group apart stood Jacques Le Ber, Le Moyne
de Longueuil, La Chesnaye, de Niverville and
Aubert de Gaspé. Some of these men had been
the Governor’s most resolute antagonists during his
first term of office, and were not at all sure of the
ground upon which they were treading or the turn
which affairs were likely to take.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now ensued a striking scene, an essential preliminary
to the treaty which the Governor-General
hoped to conclude with the Indians. Few white men
have ever surpassed the Count in skill in dealing with
the aborigines. Those who had succeeded to his
position after his recall to France had utterly failed
in this direction. The only hope of maintaining this
little settlement planted in the wilderness was in inducing
the other Indian tribes to unite in a determined
resistance to the encroachments of the Iroquois.
He now listened to their orators with gravest
attention, as though weighing every word that was
uttered. When, in his turn, he addressed them with
an air of mingled kindness, firmness and condescension
that inspired them with respect, their expressions
of approval came at every pause in his
address. Then with the same ceremonious grace
with which he might have bowed before Louis the
Magnificent, the Governor grasped the hatchet,
brandished it skilfully in the air, and in a clear, strong
voice, intoned the war-song. To a punctilious
courtier the position might have seemed utterly
absurd, but Frontenac was a man of the world in
the widest sense, and as much at home in a wigwam
as in the halls of princes; as a diplomat he retained a
clear, logical perception of all the facts of the situation.
Many, under such circumstances, would have lost
respect by an undignified performance, but the
Count’s native tact enabled him to harmonize the
most incongruous elements; the faculty of imitativeness,
the utter absence of self-consciousness, the
determination faithfully to execute a disagreeable
duty, served his purpose. Instead of exciting ridicule
his achievements delighted the Indians, aroused his
friends to enthusiasm, and extorted a reluctant
admiration even from the most determined of his
opponents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This poor M. le Gouverneur! he possesses my
sincere sympathy. Figure to yourself how these cries
and howls, worse indeed than those made by the wild
beasts of the forest, must prove trying to the throat,”
remarked the Marquise, with a sincere appreciation of
the loyalty involved in undergoing so very objectionable
an ordeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The principal officers present followed the example
of their chief; indeed, not a little ambition was shown
as to who should go through the ceremony with the
most perfect accuracy, and some of the younger
members of the party, who had become familiar with
forest life, displayed much agility and derived apparent
enjoyment from the ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the savages stood stolid, silent, making no
response to the invitation extended to them. It was
an interval of anxious suspense. Suddenly the
Christian Iroquois of the two neighboring missions
rose and joined the Frenchmen; then, as though impelled
by some irresistible impulse, the Hurons and
Algonquins of Lake Nipissing did the same. One
wild tribe after another followed this example, until
the whole troop joined in the stamping and screeching
like an army of madmen, and the Governor with
grave dignity led the dance, stamping and whooping
like the rest. The heathen allies at last were
thoroughly aroused. With the wildest enthusiasm
they snatched the proffered hatchet and swore war to
the death against the common enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came a solemn war-feast. Barrels of wine
with abundant supplies of tobacco were served out
to the guests. Two oxen and several large dogs had
been chopped to pieces for the occasion and boiled
with a quantity of prunes. Kettles were carried in,
and their steaming contents ladled into the wooden
bowls with which each provident guest had supplied
himself. Seated in a ring on the grass, the Indians
began eagerly to devour the food placed before them.
It was a point of conscience not to flinch, and they
gorged themselves until they fairly choked with repletion.
It was not a pleasant sight, yet the colonists
regarded it with some complacency, seeing that it
meant prosperity and security against danger.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI.</h1></div>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:.9em;'><span class='it'>THE ANNUAL FAIR.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HE following day witnessed the opening of the
great Annual Fair. Trade was in full activity;
never had Canada known a more prosperous commerce
than now in the midst of her dangers and
tribulations. That very morning, to the overwhelming
joy of the citizens of Ville Marie, Le Durantaye,
late Commandant at Michillimackinac, arrived with
fifty canoes, manned by French traders and filled
with valuable furs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Merchants of high and low degree had brought up
their most tempting goods from Quebec, and every
inhabitant of Montreal of any substance sought by
every means in his power to gain a share of the profit.
The booths were set along the palisades of the town,
and each had an expert interpreter, to whom the
trader usually promised a certain portion of his gains.
The payment was in card money—common playing
cards—each stamped with a crown and a <span class='it'>fleur de lys</span>.
The newly arrived French bushrangers were the
heroes of the hour and appeared to enjoy their
popularity. All the taverns were full. The coureurs
de bois conducted themselves like the crew of a
man-of-war paid off after a long voyage, and their
fellow-countrymen, in the prevailing good-humor of
the moment, willingly condoned their excesses.
Many of them were painted and feathered like
their wild Indian companions, whose ways they
imitated with perfect success. Some appeared brutally
savage, but often their bronzed countenances
expressed only dare-devil courage and reckless gaiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These gentry will live like lords, and set no
bounds to their revelry as long as their beaver-skins
last; then they will starve till they can go off to the
countries up above there to seek a fresh supply.
Swaggering, spending all their gains on dress and
feasting, they even try to imagine themselves nobles,
and despise the honest peasants, whose daughters
they will not marry, even though they are themselves
peasant-born,” said one priest to another, as he eyed
with evident disapproval the noisy, reckless crew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The windows on St. Paul Street were thrown open
and crowded with ladies; the benches before every
door were thronged. One woman of the poorer sort
had a half-dressed baby in her arms; another a
lettuce that she was washing; a third held a little
bowl of soup, which she ate in the street, gesticulating
with such frantic energy that her sabots rattled
on the stones. All dreaded to lose any part of the
show.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gathering about the market-place represented
all classes and conditions. There were merchants
engaged in serious negotiations, grave priests of St.
Sulpice, suave, smiling Jesuits, plump, good-humored
Recollets. Gentlemen critically examined the crowd
as it passed, exchanging salutations with friends and
acquaintances, commenting with the slyest of chuckles
upon the appearance of the ladies. Habitants, in
plain, coarse attire, and their brown buxom wives,
more gaily attired, chattered volubly. Indians stalked
about with stoical and haughty composure. Children,
in close caps without borders, and long-waisted gowns
and vests, an exact imitation of the dress of their
elders, shouted and gambolled with all the exuberance
of youth. Plumed soldiers swaggered jauntily about,
arquebus on shoulder. Licensed beggars abounded,
wearing ostentatiously their certificate of poverty
signed by some local judge or curé. French musicians
with drum, trumpet and cymbal did their best
to swell the tumult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All this tintamarre presages well for the colony,”
decided Nanon as she followed her mistress. “Beaver-skins
and trade and money, it means absolutely the
same thing, and all good in their way. I like not the
way things are going, either. My poor little generous
demoiselle! That soft, sleek, splendid cat of an English
girl, for all her feigned innocence, still makes
eyes at the Sieur du Chesne. Is it only I who have
eyes to spy her tricks? For me, I waste not my
breath on the melancholy; no patience have I for
jeremiads. Tell not your secret in the eyes of the
cat, but it is I, Nanon Benest, who will at once sew
in the lappet of that gallant’s coat an image of St.
Felix to secure him from charms and lead him in
the right way. And it was I who dreaded the evil
eye from the first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oui-da! oui-da!</span> we are in despair for time, my
friends. Shall we then lose the chance of making a
sou when it alights at our very door—we who have
been breaking our hearts for trade so long,” panted a
stout woman, followed by two sturdy lads, as she resolutely
pushed her way through the crowd. “Place,
there, <span class='it'>ma bibiche</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nanon reddened and flouted like an enraged turkey
gobbler at this unceremonious address.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thy <span class='it'>bibiche!</span> indeed, that were an honor to be
coveted. I know thee, wife of Chauvin the younger,
whose son Louis was turned back from his confirmation
for running the woods when he should have been
ringing the bells. And old Pepin, who is like a sour
crab-apple. <span class='it'>Scaramouch!</span> knowest thou to whom
thou speakest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The struggling, jesting, good-humored assembly
found no lack of diversion. Two men, who had been
arrested for theft, were exposed in the pillory, each
having on his chest a record of the offence committed.
One, a sturdy rogue to whom such correction was
likely enough not a novelty, looked boldly around
with a certain humorous appreciation of the situation;
the other, younger and more sensitive to the
shame of his position, sat with bowed head and
downcast eyes, while a herald, after beating a drum
to call attention to the announcement, proclaimed
aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>De par le roi.</span> Know, then, nobles, citizens,
peasants, that by order of His Majesty the King,
Candide Bourdon and Xavier Cointet, accused and
found guilty of theft, are condemned to two days in
the pillory and two hundred livres damages, payable
to the religious ladies of the Hotel-Dieu.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd cast mud and abuse liberally at the
culprits, and Migeon the bailiff, an imposing personage
in the dignity of his uniform, contemplated the
whole affair with an easy and affable air of proprietorship.
Bayard the notary—a man of consequence
in the town as being thoroughly conversant
with everybody’s business affairs; lean and brown
and wrinkled, wearing narrow robes with a collar
almost ecclesiastical in appearance, and waistband to
match, whose brown wig in the ardor of controversy
was constantly being pushed crooked—was settling a
dispute between two traders, who in their eagerness
seemed ready to tear the mediator to pieces. In
another spot, to the intense delight of the populace,
the effigies of two Indians were being consumed in a
roaring fire. Sentence of death had been passed
upon two savages, who, escaping, had regained their
native haunts. Justice therefore for the moment was
obliged to content herself with wreaking vengeance
upon their inanimate representatives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amid all this throng du Chesne found friends and
companions of every degree. His father, a man of
sound rather than brilliant qualities, was respected,
but was too cautious and distrustful to be liked
except by those who knew him well. His brother
Pierre was reverenced as a saint but despised as a
man. It was du Chesne who monopolized the popularity
accorded to the family. His charming lightness
of manner expressed confidence rather than
carelessness; he was interested in everybody’s concerns
and carried about with him a buoyancy of
spirit which acted like a tonic upon all with whom he
came in contact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean Ameron, Le Ber’s valet, was describing to a
soldier recently arrived from France the burning of
four Indians, which had taken place not long before
at the Jesuit Square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is nothing to look at,” pointing to the
squirming bundles of clothes rapidly being consumed
by the flames. “These people of whom I am telling
you exhibited a marvellous courage and endurance.
That is the Indian fashion. But, see you, faith of
Jean Ameron, that was something to laugh at.
Their agony lasted six hours, during which they
never ceased to sing their own warlike deeds. Four
brothers, they were, the largest and handsomest men
I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Burned to death?” inquired the soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not precisely that. It was a form of torment
the Indians themselves have invented. They were
tied to stakes, driven deep into the earth, and every
one of our savage allies, aye, and some Frenchmen,
too—in truth, I myself also took part in the affair,
and it requires courage to touch an Iroquois—even
when tied to a stake he might get loose, and their
looks are like those of demons. Every one of us,
believe you, armed himself with a piece of iron
heated red-hot, with which we scorched all the bodies
of the heathens from head to foot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, fault of me, too-well treated were those
pagans,” interrupted a sunburnt voyageur, whose
head was adorned with waving red feathers, “Drinking
brandy that disappeared down their throats as
quickly as though it had been poured into a hole
made in the earth. They were provided with all
they desired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah! that explains itself; the brandy was to
deaden their sufferings,” added a woman standing by.
“Better chance had those heathens than many Christians.
The Fathers baptized them, addressing merely
a few brief words of exhortation (for to do more
would be merely washing a death’s head), and free
from their sins they ascended straight to Heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, while trade and amusement were in the
full tide of activity, high above the babble of chattering
and bargaining and the echo of jovial laughter
rose the death-cry. Instantly every sound and
motion ceased; it was as though a sudden spell had
fallen upon the busy gathering, an awed, breathless
silence. Once, twice, eight times it was heard, rising
and falling in weird cadences. Its significance was
perfectly comprehended by the listeners, most of
whom were habituated to modes of savage warfare.
This was the signal given by a war-party returning
in triumph with the scalps of eight enemies. Every
man snatched his weapon, and for a time all was
confusion. Among the authorities hurriedly whispered
consultations took place, then, inspired by a
sudden and irresistible impulse, soldiers, priests,
traders, Indians, women and children, all rushed off
in the direction whence the sound proceeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man of gigantic stature, painted, greased and
feathered like an Indian, and almost as swarthy of
complexion, strode forward with a majestic air of
composure, as though enjoying a happy sense of his
own importance. In one hand he held eight long
sticks from which were suspended a like number of
lank waving tresses. In front of him, tied together
like children in leading strings, walked two squaws
with downcast eyes, whose resigned and stoical countenances
looked as though carved out of wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who can this be?” each one asked his neighbor.
“He is one of ours, a Frenchman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly among the voyageurs a cry arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Dubocq, or his spirit—no, it <span class='it'>is</span> Dubocq, yes,
truly, Dubocq!” Then they raised a resounding
shout of welcome—“Vive Dubocq! our brave Dubocq,
our champion against our enemies!”</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:.9em;'><span class='it'>A CANADIAN BUSHRANGER.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>D</span>UBOCQ smiled condescendingly upon the
enthusiasm with which his appearance was
greeted; he accepted with sedateness the embraces
and warm congratulations of his friends, but, perfectly
conscious of his own dignity, resolutely refused to
divulge any of the particulars of his story until he
reached M. de Callière, Governor of Ville Marie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia, by nature timid, had no idea of controlling
her fears when comfort and succor of an especially
pleasant description were close at hand. She now
clung to du Chesne for protection, her face irradiated
by a lovely expression, half smiles, half tears. Did
ever sculptor chisel a mouth where all sweet graces
curved more bewitchingly? The young man noted
the upward sweep of the long lashes, the exquisite
flush deepening in the cheeks and melting into the
warm whiteness of brow and chin and throat. How
engaging this clinging helplessness was!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a savage!” the English girl exclaimed
with a shiver, “I shall never get over my terror of all
Indians.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Du Chesne’s glowing eyes rested on her face; the
fervent glance cheered and strengthened her. Lydia
required to be supported constantly, and she enjoyed
the exhilarating sensation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mademoiselle, he is of our own country. His
grandfather was a Frenchman from Normandy, who
married a squaw, Marie Arontio, daughter of the first
Huron chief baptized by, the sainted Father de
Breboeuf. Ah! Mademoiselle, but that was a martyr
worthy of the faith! Sainte Marie Madeleine, a nun
of the Ursulines, in Quebec, is Dubocq’s sister. He
has always been considered one of our best fighters,
an adept in Indian modes of warfare, and a man of
great courage and extraordinary strength. Some
years ago he was taken prisoner by our enemies, and
as time went on and nothing was heard of him, all
believed him dead. That was a genuine loss for the
colony; we could ill afford to spare one of our best
champions; hence his return occasions so much
rejoicing. He has contrived to escape the clutches of
the most ferocious savages in the world, at whose
hands he could expect nothing but agonizing torments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd, following the bushranger with shouts
and cheers, proceeded up St. Joseph Street to the
residence of M. de Callière. The Count de Frontenac,
attended by several members of his suite, happened
to be within. Disturbed by the noise, the party, led
by M. de Callière, hurried to the door to inquire into
the cause of the commotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have we here?” asked the Governor-General,
who possessed a singular faculty for endearing
himself to the populace by being interested in all
his surroundings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dubocq! Dubocq has returned! Dubocq! Vive
our champion, Dubocq!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The forest rover with composed assurance advanced
to exhibit his trophies, and in answer to the Governor’s
enquiries, recounted the history of his exploits
with much natural eloquence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was taken prisoner by the Iroquois,” he began,
“and for a long time I labored as their slave. They
found my strength useful in many ways. For me, I
devoured my heart in silence, M. le Comte, for no way
of escape seemed possible, and if it was my fate to
perish in the hands of those demons, why, there was
no more to be said. So I was waiting with what
patience I could muster for the fatal moment in which
I was to be burnt alive. It happened on an occasion
when I was engaged in hunting with eight braves and
two squaws”—(here he indicated with a gesture his
two female companions, who had never even raised
their eyes or given the slightest indication that they
knew their fate was trembling in the balance)—“we
camped in a spot where they had hidden a quantity of
liquor. Having been on two war expeditions in
which they had performed prodigies of valor, they
had succeeded in enriching themselves at their
enemies’ expense, and were at the time visiting the
liquor as a rest and indulgence after much privation.
Desiring to carry nothing with them but their arms
and ammunition, they had been fasting for many
days; so, as you may imagine, M. le Comte, those
wolves were not inclined to be very abstemious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the custom of these pagans to swallow
brandy at a gulp, easier than we take light wine at
our most jovial parties,” whispered Jean Ameron to
his friend, who was a keenly interested spectator of
all that was going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After supper,” continued the hero of the occasion,
“they commenced drinking and singing, according to
their own ideas of enjoyment. Considering me as a
victim about to be sacrificed to their vengeance, they
invited me to join their orgy, with the comforting
assurance that it would be my last opportunity, as
they had decided to put an end to me at once.
Being for the moment all companions in pleasure,
they sang loudly, with joyful hearts celebrating their
victories. They persisted in forcing quantities of the
liquor on me. Though in usual well inclined to
drink, I restrained my inclination, knowing that
should I become helpless my fate would be at once
sealed. After raising the brandy to my mouth I
allowed it to spill, and as the wigwam was illuminated
only by the uncertain light of the fire, the savages did
not notice my evasion of their hospitable intentions.
By this means I retained my composure, while by
the middle of the night my companions, whose heads
were heated by drink and the war-songs they had
sung, were overcome by sleep. I made no movement,
but feigned to be the drunkest of all the party, though
watching quietly like a fox. Faith of Dubocq! the
Iroquois and I, we know each other well, and here it
was a question of life and death. I debated seriously
whether when I found them all helpless, completely
at my mercy, I should profit at once by my liberty,
or whether before leaving I should send those ten
heathen to the land of souls. As for the braves, that
meant eight enemies less for the colony. Then, M. le
Gouverneur, ladies, gentlemen and friends,” with a
grandiloquent flourish of the hand towards the unhappy
prisoners, who still stood mute, like bronzed
images of resignation, “then I resolved to spare these
women as being unworthy a man’s vengeance, and
also as witnesses of my triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>V’là!</span> I commenced by tying the squaws tightly
together, comprehending well that, having smaller
brains than the men, they were more easily intoxicated
and consequently more difficult to awaken.
And, I assure you, they had not stinted themselves in
the use of the liquor. I resolved to make sure, however,
trusting my fate to no chance which I had power
to provide against. In order to try if their sleep were
really so profound as it appeared, I held pieces of
flaming wood close to their faces; but, behold! not a
movement, not so much as the quiver of an eyelash.
My opportunity had come; it but depended upon the
strength of my own arm to escape death by torture.
I have seen that; I know what it is; so do many of
you, my friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd responded to this appeal by a quick
sympathetic murmur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many of us have witnessed the death of our comrades,
many bear scars of the wounds inflicted by
those wolves. That thought nerved my heart. Arming
myself with a heavy hatchet, I dealt one warrior
after another a deadly blow, and that with the
greatest rapidity. If one should awaken and give
the alarm, then I was lost. <span class='it'>Tiens!</span> it was all finished
in a crack. It was a cold butchery, I grant you, M.
le Comte, but what will you, then? The choice lay
between my death and theirs. Imagine to yourself
when a man fights in the name of his lord the King,
his Lord God, the holy saints and angels, and his
own safety. I owed the Iroquois many a debt, and I
endeavored honestly to pay them all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tried vainly to awaken the two women, who
still slept soundly. Then I sat down to smoke my
pipe and indulge in many pleasant memories of the
home which I had never thought to see again. We
had still a long and dangerous journey before us, so
it was necessary to set about making preparations.
Next morning when the two women regained their
senses I allowed them to perceive that a change had
taken place in the position of affairs—that they had
at the one stroke become widows and my slaves. I
could not suppose that they were pleased by the
course of events, but they said little. I assured them
that I would spare their lives on condition that they
would bear witness to the truth of my story, and they
agreed with the best possible resignation. I may make
them my compliments on their docility; never have
they troubled me with useless lamentations. When
I had adjusted my scalps to my taste—and you will
perceive, M. le Comte, that they are arranged in true
savage fashion—I took them and my prisoners and
started upon my journey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vive, Dubocq, who has killed eight Iroquois at a
blow! Vive Dubocq!” shouted the excited and sympathetic
crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they are monsters! One hears only of
shedding of blood.” In her agitation Lydia had
seized hold of du Chesne’s hand, at which a thrill
went through the young man’s veins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All this is far removed from you; it is not fit
that you should hear such tales. You should be surrounded
by scenes of peace and tenderness. Cannot
you trust yourself to my care, my sweet Lydia?” he
urged tenderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Canadian felt himself completely fascinated
by this fair childish beauty. There was
something in the girl’s guileless expression, the sight
of her hair flowing in waves of gold over the shapely
shoulders, that ensnared his heart. Then his efforts
at consolation were so very successful, and were so
gratefully received, that he could not fail to be thoroughly
satisfied. Diane de Monesthrol might accept
tribute of general admiration if it pleased her to do
so; for his part, he preferred the sweetly feminine
creature who was pleased to receive rather than
confer distinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frontenac, himself a brave man, had always shown
cordial sympathy for the reckless courage of the
voyageurs and bushrangers. He now readily gave
utterance to his commendations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ta, ta, ta! bravely done, my fine fellow. These
are the sort of defenders that Canada requires; would
that we had many more of them. Eight enemies
killed at a stroke! He is a Canadian hero; we owe
him the thanks of the colony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Et par le corbeau</span>,” grumbled Jean Ameron, who
made desperate but futile attempts to imitate the
soldiers in the jaunty swagger of their manner.
“Heroes, like saints, are cheap in this country. To
kill eight Iroquois, that were easily enough done—just
one sharp blow skilfully directed, and all is over.
Little more effort is required than for killing a mouse.
Thirty livres, no less, is the price paid for each scalp;
two hundred and forty livres will this bird of prey
receive from the Government. It was but chance
that placed the occasion in Dubocq’s way. Some
are favored by luck; I could myself do as much as
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jean, my friend, thou art not of those whose light
is suffered to hide under bushels,” protested the
soldier.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Maître Bourdon, hast thou good wine at thy
tavern?” demanded Frontenac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But yes, plenty, and of the most excellent, M. le
Comte; of many kinds also, to suit all tastes—Vin de
Grève, both the white and the red, wine of Xeres,
Muscat—” the little fat man was delighted to seize
the opportunity of proclaiming the prime quality of
his wares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drink, then, my friends, to the health of His
Majesty, and to that of the brave Dubocq, not forgetting
the prosperity of Canada, and confusion to
our enemies, the Iroquois!”</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:.9em;'><span class='it'>PIERRE’S TEMPTATION.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HE grounds attached to Jacques Le Ber’s house
were laid out partly as a flower and partly as a
kitchen garden. They were divided by broad gravelled
walks, bordered with fragrant herbs and deliciously
sweet old-fashioned plants. Orange and
oleander trees in green boxes stood here and there.
Along the side of the wall grew pear trees, currant
bushes and grape vines. Sweetness of fragrance and
brilliancy of color were everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the garden one morning had hung a dense
fog, which, lifting, revealed radiant glimpses of blue
sky, distant mountain and shining river. The trees,
silvered by the light, seemed to rush gladly out of the
mist, and the still fleeing remnants of vapor gave
grace and movement to every object over which their
trembling shadows passed. The air was sweet with
growth and blossom, glad with song of birds, quiver of
leaves, and flicker of sunshine and shadow. Pierre
Le Ber, strolling leisurely down a shady path with
his breviary in his hands, his lips moving in silent
prayer, resolutely strove to steel his heart against
all the harmonies of nature. His tall, slight figure,
emaciated by ceaseless vigils and penances, showed
the high and narrow forehead, thin-lipped sensitive
mouth, and deep dreamy eyes of the enthusiast.
As he walked the sound of a tender lullaby broke
upon his meditations. Instead of soothing him, however,
the gentle strains seemed to produce a strangely
disturbing effect upon the ascetic’s mind. His brow
showed deep corrugations, his lips were compressed
in quick irritation. With the warm sunshine and the
fresh morning air, laden with the scent of opening
blossoms, there seemed to glide into his senses, to
thrill through every vein and nerve, an instinct of
hope and consciousness of pleasure, a sensation of
peace and easy indulgence alluring as a child’s dream.
He had been troubled in mind; now the very air he
breathed seemed to offer consolation. Vainly he tried
to forget that he was still young, and that the world
was beautiful. He was impatient of his own thoughts,
and filled with indignant astonishment that after
ceaseless efforts to suppress the claims of the body
such trifles should have power to occupy his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As these thoughts crowded upon poor Pierre he
made a violent effort to fling them from him as something
intrusive. He would go away, he would resist
this entrancing influence. Turning hastily he found
himself close to Diane de Monesthrol. She was
carrying, easily and lightly, little Léon, the crippled
orphan whose parents had both perished at the massacre
of Le Chesnaye, and who had himself been
grievously maimed by blows from an Indian tomahawk.
His spine was injured, and he had but now
been suffering from one of those paroxysms of pain
which occasionally tortured him. The violence of
the attack over, the child, soothed and exhausted,
was falling asleep; the heavy blue-veined lids were
slowly closing, while the girl bent over him with
wistful tenderness. She laid the little one down
beneath the shade of a wide-spreading tree, supported
by cushions, and then, as she turned, encountered
Pierre’s earnest gaze. Le Ber’s eldest son was seized
with a sincere conviction that he would be better away
from his father’s beautiful ward, yet he stood silent,
rooted to the spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Life just then to Diane was a vague, sweet chaos.
Rejoicing in the strength of her ardent youth, it was
not easy to accept existence calmly and tranquilly.
Every day the sunshine seemed brighter, the sky
above her more blue. It was always to her an
amusement to tantalize and provoke Pierre, who was
curiously sensitive to every girlish taunt. Professing
as he did to despise feminine charms, it seemed a
frolic to the girl to show him that he was not so
invulnerable as he chose to fancy himself. Diane was
aware that Anne Barroy was peering anxiously from
a side window, and Anne’s sharp, jealous eyes had
already detected the weakness which the young man
could never have been brought to acknowledge. It
was like a child heedlessly playing with fire, for she
had formed no conception of what strong human
passion might mean. Just to tease Pierre was the
impulse of the moment—a thing which she had done
a hundred times before and never bestowed a thought
upon. Long years afterwards, looking back on her life,
it seemed to Diane that on that fragrant summer day,
in Le Ber’s sunny garden, she had taken leave forever
of her free and careless youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is thus I would always see you, Diane,” Pierre
exclaimed eagerly, “engaged in works of charity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take charge of the little Léon simply because
Nanon is occupied with Madame la Marquise,” Mademoiselle
de Monesthrol explained carelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You spend so much time and thought on those
things which are unworthy of you,” the young man
could not forbear exhorting her, “lace and low
dresses, fontanges and strange trinkets, the immodest
curls expressly forbidden by St. Peter and St.
Paul, as well as by all the Fathers and Doctors of the
Church, the pomp of sin, the favorite devices of
Satan. In their wish to please men, women make
themselves the instruments and captives of the arch
fiend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane flashed a swift, bright, audacious glance at
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do the ladies try to win your favor, cousin? I
thought they all feared you. You must acknowledge
I have never shown any desire to please you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the still sunny air, in the warmth and glow of a
life which he could not stifle, standing face to face
with the loveliest eyes he had ever seen, Pierre found
himself engaged in an unusual conflict, and felt he
must utter a vehement protest against the fatal,
alluring attraction. The peculiar susceptibility to
impressions which rendered him pliant to priestly
influence also gave rise to endless complications
against which he had no defence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cast from you that levity destructive to the soul,”
he urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is levity that I delight in,” she replied,
tapping a dainty high-heeled shoe upon the gravelled
walk. “One can be young but once. When old age
overtakes me I shall devote myself to good works.
When that time comes then shall we, perhaps, be
better friends; at that season I may perchance enjoy
your sermons, cousin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pierre strove hard to maintain his tone of gentle
superiority and to continue the discussion on a line of
persuasive argument, but he was nervously impatient.
A tinge of uncertainty was shadowed in his manner,
a tumultuous excitement, a badgered, hopeless, still
struggling shame. It was not often that he had the
opportunity of holding a long conversation with the
girl; he felt obliged to make the best of the occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the doctrine of the devil. Canada is indeed
the fold of Christ, but the hosts of this world
are beleaguering the sanctuary. Diane, is the glory
of the Church to suffer prejudice from your actions?
We are in the midst of sin. Remember that death is
close at hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These words jarred upon Diane’s mood. She resented
Pierre’s air of dissatisfied inspection, his
assumption that his own judgment must be fundamentally
and eternally right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let me be happy while I may. All have
not the vocation to be saints and martyrs. We are
young, the sun shines, life is fair and sweet, and God
is good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pierre looked at her in evident anger, the wrathful
disguise of tortured love. His reason was hampered
in its action. He was unable to exercise any discriminating
faculty. There was something pathetic in his
insistence, for he plainly perceived that his importunities
were unavailing. His desire for sympathy
was so urgent and all occupying that he could not
thrust it aside. The proud, untamable creature, so
arch, so kind, so generous, with her whims and
caprices and beauty, alive with spirit and energy,
seemed to him the embodiment of all he had renounced.
Had he only the power to mould her into
an entirely different form, to convert her into a bloodless
personification of sanctity, he was convinced that
he would be saving her soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Diane,”—he could not control the quivering of
his voice—“Diane, the Holy Virgin will transform
into angels all those who have the happiness to
abandon the cares of this life. Will you not drink of
the living and abounding waters of grace which have
flowed so benignly over this land of New France?
Misfortune is about to fall upon this household, how
or when I have no power to tell, but it is sorrow and
death; when I would pray, a dark presentiment
weighs my spirit to the earth—there is no escape
from it. Diane,” he cried with yearning entreaty,
“though you have cast in your lot with the world, the
robe of God’s saints awaits you; but that means suffering
deep and terrible, the crucifixion of what is
dearest. In my dreams you are ever present, but
always among the holy ones, crowned with the exceeding
glory of the martyrs worn only by those who
have reached the fairest ideal of heaven’s attainment,
who have risen above all earthly joys and affections.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane was confused and awed, and withal much
annoyed, at this address. It did not touch her as it
might have done a woman of wider experience. She
had a just faith in her own instincts, and was possessed
of all the happy confidence of youth. What
had she to do with suffering and misery? she, Diane
de Monesthrol, surrounded by affection, to whom the
plant of life was daily blossoming out into fuller perfection,
the happiest girl in all the colony of New
France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! listen then, cousin, to the tumult in the
street.” Diane was delighted at the diversion. “Is it
the voyageurs? nay, but it is the gentlemen.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The jovial strains of the chorus broke on the stillness
of the garden like a disturbing influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the music, cousin, how entrancingly gay!
When I hear the music I must dance; the desire is
stronger than I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inspired by an impulse of wild mirth and the love
of frolic, enlivened by the knowledge that Anne
Barroy still kept an inquisitive watch at her shaded
window, Diane began to circle and pirouette around
the astonished young man. Gradually she surrendered
herself to the influence of the music,
allowing its rhythm to govern her movements. The
lithe young form fell into flexible attitudes; it was a
delight to mark the exquisite grace of her gestures,
the suppleness of her limbs, the action of her swiftly
twinkling feet. This was no wild whirl of abandonment;
the smooth, swaying movement was stately
and dignified; but to Pierre it meant the essence of
sorcery. Was ever fairer creature formed? Her attractions
were vivid, imperious, irresistible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane herself was full of intense sensation and
susceptibility to every new impression. The color
deepened in her soft cheeks. She was no longer a
heedless, guileless child; the soul of a woman, ardent
and seductive, flamed in her sweet blue eyes. Pierre
flushed with sudden mortification. For an instant he
hated the girl and hated himself. His glance, first
gently pleading, then sternly disapproving, changed
swiftly to some keener emotion. He had been tolerably
calm until he reached this point, then the blood
began to course hotly through his veins; he found
himself drifting upon wild unknown currents, carried
beyond the safe limits of ecclesiastical restraint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Diane! Diane!” he cried, breaking in suddenly
as if suffocated. All the girlish fun and mischief
faded out of her eyes, Diane de Monesthrol’s cheeks
flamed with shame and fierce resentment. What did
this new light of revelation mean? In her carelessness
had she cruelly injured the son of one who had
been her protector? Who was Pierre that he should
dare to look at her with such eyes? She could have
killed him as he stood. With the keen quivering of
heart and soul she gained a glimpse of some of the
deeper things of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Hola!</span> Diane and—and Pierre!” As he parted
the branches of the thicket and stood revealed before
the actors in this extraordinary scene, his surprise
quite as great as their own, du Chesne’s expression
of utter consternation was so extremely comic that
Diane broke into peals of ringing laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This added the last touch to Pierre’s misery. A sudden
panic and horror seized him, furrowing his countenance
as if with the action of years. As his brother’s
frank glance rested on him, giddy, as if buffeted by
wind and tide in the midst of heat and passion, he
paused with a convulsive shiver. He was conscious
of falling from a great height to dread discomfiture
and humiliation. The girl’s beauty had kindled an
emotion which glowed in his brain, leaped like wildfire
from conjecture to conclusion, and carried all
before it in an irresistible exhilaration. This was
succeeded by the inevitable reaction. A sob, suppressed
yet unrestrainable, escaped him. All three,
the girl and the two young men, moved by a
common instinct, glanced apprehensively up at the
window where, from the heights of superior sanctity,
the recluse might be looking down upon the trivial
worldly passions and interests of her kindred. Pierre
disappeared. Diane would have been glad to do the
same, but mentally pulling herself together she conquered
the cowardly impulse and sank panting down
on the grass, shamed to the depths of her soul by du
Chesne’s look of mingled wonder and reproach.</p>

asked du Chesne. “But, no, it cannot be—not
Pierre, who disapproves of worldly amusements.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That melancholy death’s head of a Pierre, he professes
to despise women; he is never content with
me; he has dared to sermonize me and I punished
him,” Diane roused herself to explain defiantly,
instinctively resenting the youth’s questioning gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Pierre—I cannot understand—Pierre is a
saint—he will scarcely raise his eyes to look at any
human being—his lips utter only prayers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they are indeed detestable, these saints,” she
returned petulantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely you would respect the virtues of those holy
ones. We may not be very perfect, we others, but
they accumulate perfections for us. Who can say
how much we owe them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Du Chesne was staunch to his teaching and traditions.
His voice had a caressing sound when he
spoke to women. A smile now parted his lips as
he threw himself on the grass beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pierre is like other men,” Diane exclaimed with
laconic positiveness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The audacity of the reply startled the young man.
He watched her with eager, wistful scrutiny. Du
Chesne was not an intellectual man, but his perceptions
were swift and keen. Could it be possible that
Diane loved Pierre, and that this affection had rendered
her insensible to the attractions of the numerous
lovers who had already sighed at her feet? It was a
startling supposition, overturning some of his fixed
ideas, but it would certainly account for many of the
caprices which had puzzled him. He was loyal to
the core, with a jealous and fervid allegiance both to
his brother and to the girl who had held the place of
a sister. Pierre was bound by solemn vows to an
ascetic life—could he be willing to decline to what he
would choose to consider a lower plane? Diane’s
affection was certainly a prize worth obtaining. No
doubt it would all come right in some way. The
glamor proceeding from the indefinite brightness of
youth, certain bewitching and yet intangible possibilities
which had enthralled his own imagination, disposed
him to accept the most hopeful view of the
situation. And, after all, the hypothesis might not
be built on sufficient foundation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Crisasi, too,” he continued, speaking without
reflection, awkwardly and anxiously. There were
curious lines of perplexity on his brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! the Chevalier is really too absurd; at his
best he is only doleful—never amusing. And you
know it is the plain duty of a man to show himself
amusing.” Diane strove to speak lightly, notwithstanding
the rising tremor in her throat. Why should
there be any restraint in the frank, pleasant comradeship
which had united them since childhood? Du
Chesne plainly comprehended none. He was so kind,
so cordial, so honestly satisfied with his own good intentions,
that it was difficult to hold him at a distance.
He held an inveterate objection to inconsistencies of
every description, and tried to reconcile two apparently
conflicting tendencies in the girl, to whom he
was sincerely attached. A vague resolve that had
been floating through his mind suddenly assumed
definite proportions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crisasi is a brave and gallant gentleman; none in
the colony is more respected. If amusement is a
necessity, choose such fops as d’Ordieux, and leave
alone the men you have power to pain. Spare the
Chevalier, Diane, he is a disappointed and heart-broken
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are as bad as Pierre! That is not like you,
du Chesne.” Mademoiselle de Monesthrol was suddenly
aroused. The blood in a rich carmine flood
mantled over her delicate face; her eyes dilated,
deepened, darkened, until their soft blue changed to
black. What was this man’s frankly expressed disapproval
to her that she should thrill and tremble at
his words. A terrible dread, latent in her heart, now
ran through her throbbing veins, her entire being
quickened by that thrill of feeling which is at once
sweetness and keenest pain. A sentiment which she
disowned, which she had fought desperately and persistently,
inch by inch, had conquered; yet to hide
the wound, to hold up her head, smiling, and, if need
be, die hiding it, was the first natural instinct. She
did not speak, for her heart was fluttering to her lips
and she could not utter a word. Yet to the tender-hearted,
wilful creature there was an excitement in
the consciousness of peril. Detection might be worse
than death; still to dare discovery, to push danger to
the very verge of exposure, furnished a thrilling agitation
which offered relief from pain. Raising her
head, as though courting rather than avoiding scrutiny,
she met du Chesne’s searching gaze with cool nonchalance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Sainte Dame!</span> and what is that to me?” with a
gesture of haughty repudiation. “Were I answerable
for the disappointments of every gentleman of New
France my lot would be indeed a sad one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clear tones of gentle disdain irritated the
young Canadian. He could scarcely restrain a
movement of impetuous anger; and yet, with the
characteristic trust of his nature, he tried to believe
the best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Diane, you know not of what you speak. It is
your inexperience that causes you to appear cruel.
Why, I remember you cried yourself sick when your
bird died, and again when Bibelot’s paw was hurt—and
then the devotion with which you have attended
little Léon shows you are no heartless woman. It
may be your time has not yet come. When it comes,
as it surely will, you will then comprehend the meaning
of true love—the happiness, the suffering, the
trust and faith.” He spoke eagerly, his glowing
boyish heart shining in his eyes. Diane could not
mistake the evidence of that fire out of which love
is born; her doubt and pride were suddenly swept
away. She had no power to confront this precious
and bewildering possibility. All existence was suddenly
raised to brilliancy and interest, as with a
sparkling draught of sunlit elixir.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>In a little closet off from Mademoiselle de Monesthrol’s
chamber stood a miniature altar. A fair ivory
image of Our Lady of Sorrows gleamed white amidst
the environment of gorgeous color; a richly chased
silver lamp burned dimly before it, and a jar of spotless
lilies was set beside the <span class='it'>prie-dieu</span> with its velvet
hassock and Book of Hours. In a fervor of devotion
the girl sank down before the altar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Virgin, bless me! Make me worthy of the
great happiness thou hast given me.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>M</span>ARRIAGEABLE women were at a premium
in the colony. Nanon in her comeliness,
activity, and audacity had since her arrival in New
France attracted many lovers. Most of these followed
her for a while, then, discouraged by her disdain, fell
away from their allegiance and married some meeker
damsel. The two who had remained most persistently
faithful to her charms, patiently enduring her tempers
and caprices year after year, were Jean the valet and
Baptiste Leroux, familiarly known as Bras de Fer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baptiste was an enormous man, over six feet two
in height, and stout in proportion. His round face
expressed an exaggeration of simplicity. His beard
was black, but the long hair he wore floating on his
shoulders was a warm auburn. His eyes, which were
nearly always half closed, gave him the appearance of
stupidity; but when moved by any unusual emotion
they opened wide, their keen brightness changing the
whole character of his countenance. The extreme
slowness of his movements imparted an air of
apathetic indolence to the massive frame. He wore a
striped blue shirt and grey trousers, with a red sash
knotted around his waist, its fringed ends hanging
down on the left side. On his head, winter and
summer, was a beaver cap. His feet were protected
by Indian boots, the upper part, of sheepskin, drawn
up over the trousers, and fastened under the knee by
narrow strips of sealskin. The sleeves of his jacket
were turned up at the elbows, displaying a pair of
huge muscular arms tattooed curiously. Malicious
people sometimes insinuated that all the good fellow’s
force lay in his physical powers, and that his intellectual
faculties were not of the brightest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eldest of a family of nineteen children born to
a poor colonist, Baptiste had been obliged from early
childhood to make his way through the world as best
he could. When still a very young lad he had
entered Le Ber’s service, where later he had shared
the games and escapades of du Chesne and his
cousins, the young le Moynes, teaching the boys the
secrets of woodcraft and the delights of forest life.
Afterwards he became a noted coureur de bois,
wandering at will through the trackless woods of
Canada, the great North-West and Louisiana, camping,
hunting, fishing, fighting, everywhere renowned
among white men and Indians for his unerring skill
as a marksman and his extraordinary strength and
courage. When severe laws were enacted against the
bushrangers, prohibiting that lawless, delightful freedom
of the wilderness to which his heart ever clung,
Leroux again took service with the Le Ber family, for
whom he felt an unswerving devotion. Among the
colonists many marvellous tales concerning Bras de
Fer’s adventures were told. Even allowing for the
exaggeration of national pride, it must be admitted
that many of these stories had a substantial foundation
in fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once it happened that on the shores of Lake
Champlain Baptiste and a younger brother were
taken prisoners by the Iroquois. The Indians, in
triumph at having secured so redoubtable an adversary,
fastened their captives to two oaken stakes
planted firmly in the ground. Fancying that Bras
de Fer, who was much the stronger of the two, would
endure torture the longer, they selected the brother as
their first victim. A savage heated his hatchet red
hot and applied it to the boy’s naked breast. Baptiste,
resigned to his fate, had prepared to chant his
death-song with a stoicism borrowed from his Iroquois
foes, but the sight of his brother’s torture roused him
to superhuman effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forty thousand tribes of demons!” he shouted,
bending himself double, and by a supreme effort
bursting the bonds that held him; then tearing the
stake out of the earth, with it he struck down four of
the Iroquois in quick succession. The assault was so
unexpected, and his attitude so terrifying, that the
remainder of the party, believing in their consternation
that they were attacked by a species of avenging
Manitou, swiftly fled, leaving Baptiste and his brother
to make their way home undisturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All Bras de Fer’s brave exploits, his renown, or the
friendly consideration with which his employers
treated him, seemed unavailing to give him advantage
over his voluble rival. Baptiste was far too
modest to boast of his own merits, and Jean was only
too ready to vaunt imaginary virtues which he liberally
attributed to himself. Nanon accepted the
homage of both in a sharp, imperious, scornful way,
never directly favoring either. Through all Baptiste
endured the most hopeless jealousy of Jean’s fluent,
deceiving tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye,” Jean declared easily and lightly, “It is the
taste of Nanon, as of all women, to coquette. It is
their privilege, and I for one would not deny it to
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His charmer was never without a ready retort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, as it is the wont of all men to be fools and
heartless apes, to run to death after any proud turkey,
and never to perceive those of real worth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing daunted, Jean continued to smoke his
pipe reflectively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never been greatly inclined to matrimony
myself. When I picture the perils through which I
have passed—aye, I myself, Jean Ameron—with
damsels of every description to choose from, brown
and blonde, fat and lean, tall and short, all awaiting
but a look, and some not absolutely ill-favored; one,
indeed, with a barrel of bacon entirely her own, was
offered me, but I found myself obliged to decline, my
friends trying in vain to persuade me to accept the
King’s gift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bras de Fer was taking his supper in the same
room. In general the stalwart voyageur had an inordinate
capacity for devouring the various colonial
dainties, such as eels in sailor guise, pigeons with
cabbages, partridges served with onions, soup with
plums, eggs and tripe, brown bread and cheese. He
had been hungry when he entered the house, but the
Frenchman’s facility of utterance quite reduced the
big Canadian’s enjoyment of his food. Were he but
master of such captivating eloquence he might long
ago have won the desire of his heart. Nanon never
appeared more attractive. Her full lips took a richer
red, a livelier crimson suffused her sunburnt cheek,
there was a dancing merriment in her bright, dark
eyes as she asked demurely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it not the damsels who escaped so sad a fate?
To me it is equal. I see on every side husbands and
wives who quarrel and spit at each other like cats,
and where is the gain, my heart? In this country it
is not difficult to marry. Brown and lean as a weasel
is Mam’selle Anne, yet even she could become a wife
if she would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baptiste felt that to sit silently listening was the
hardest trial he had ever endured. He had been no
stranger to manifold dangers and adventures, having
served as guide in nine expeditions against the Five
Cantons. He had killed with his own hand more
than sixty Iroquois, had twice been tied to the stake
waiting to be burned alive; had bravely sung the
death-song, while the joints of two of his fingers had
been broken, after they had been smoked in an Indian
pipe; had in genuine savage fashion learned to mock
at his own torments, when a necklace of hatchets,
heated red hot, had been suspended round his neck,
causing wounds of which he still kept the scars; yet
with all this his valor failed him when he had most
need of it. He could have demolished his paltry
rival at a blow, yet he dared not contemplate the
possibility of having Nanon turn on him with scorn
and anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nanon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a tremendous effort Baptiste concentrated his
will. Rising, he left his untasted supper with the determination
to crush his rival’s pretensions, plead his
own suit, or perish in the attempt! At the impassioned
utterance of her name the girl quickly turned
her head. When he felt the sharp, bright glance of
his beloved resting upon him, the giant’s courage
oozed away. With a long drawn sigh he sank back
on his chair disconsolately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please, Bras de Fer?” Nanon inquired
politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baptiste shook his head with the most helpless and
mournful resignation; both ideas and words had
escaped him; he felt himself turning hot and cold
all over as he gazed at her deprecatingly. Nanon
shrugged her plump shoulders with an air of amused
amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What wouldst thou say, Bras de Fer? Surely
thou wouldst not make sugar-plum compliments like
those of Jean? Is it the week of the three Thursdays,
that thou shouldst attempt to make compliments?
Even Balaam’s ass had the power of speech conferred
upon it at times, but thine eloquence is overpowering.
Ta, ta, ta! there would be no peace in Paradise if
thou wert there, unless thou couldst contrive to mend
thy manners, my friend.” Nanon’s brown face dimpled
with coquettish smiles, and Jean indulged in a
malicious grin for which the Canadian could have
found it in his heart to slay him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was constancy to thy attractions, it was disinclination
to marriage with another, that prevented me
from entering the forest, engaging in warfare against
the Iroquois, becoming a renowned fighter, and making
my fortune in the fur trade,” pursued the imperturbable
Jean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think, then, and is it truly so?” Nanon interposed
with exasperating simplicity, “and I had really
believed that it was thine own cowardice that made
thee prefer the ease of home to ranging the woods
with the savages and wild beasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, yes, such is really the case. A cow, a
pair of swine, a pair of fowls, two barrels of salted
meat, and eleven crowns in good money have my
own constancy and thine hard-heartedness cost me.
Surely some recompense may be considered my due.
And during all these long years I have been pursued
by a frightful nightmare, a dream of awakening to
find myself a husband against my will. Consider
how sad a fate, my good Nanon; and when once the
ceremony is performed, no redress, for when the
Church binds she ties fast; one fastens a knot with
the tongue which the hands cannot untie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nanon smiled complacently upon all this, until
Baptiste, who felt that he had reached the extreme
limit of endurance, rushed out. Then the
girl promptly gathered up her work and prepared
to ascend to her mistress’s apartment. Jean made
another attempt to detain her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Nanon, I have observation, me. I see many
things. I would tell a secret but between ourselves.
It is the blonde English demoiselle whom the Sieur du
Chesne adores, and not the most noble the demoiselle
de Monesthrol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ruddy peasant face flamed into fiery wrath.
That her lady’s attractions should be cheapened, that
her pretensions should be slighted, infuriated the devoted
maid. Such a dread had awakened in her own
mind—would another dare to put it into words?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guard thy mouth! And is it a good-for-nothing
of thy species who will dare to compare my demoiselle—the
daughter of great nobles who fought and
bled for the King—to any dirt of bourgeois? It is
with such as the Comte de Frontenac—except that
M. le Gouverneur has already had the ill-luck to make
choice of a lady, and if report speaks true, of one not
so admirable either—that our demoiselle should mate.
<span class='it'>Bête!</span> cease, then, thy bellowing and mend thy manners.
Like a serpent thou wouldst bite the hand that
nourishes thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In terror Jean fled from the storm he had evoked.
Nanon stood wringing her hands and stamping her
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In truth, I know not whether to weep like a
watering-pot or to scratch somebody’s eyes out.
Ah! if I could but reach that craven-hearted wolf
with my nails. The worst sting of all is that it is all
true. And this English girl will pay him with his
own coin, loving herself always best and last, with
but small thought to spare for anyone else. My noble,
proud mistress who smiles and is happy, seeing nothing,
decking that other one in her best, and never
weary of praising that one’s beauty and sweetness.
Sweetness?—it is the look of the cat at the cream.
The neuvena I made in honor of that worthless St.
Joseph, with the intention of securing our little lady’s
happiness, all goes for nothing. That useless image
shall no longer delude innocent believers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a whirlwind the serving-woman swept to the
altar where stood the figure of St. Joseph, serenely
unconscious of the enormity of his own offences, or of
the storm which was about to descend upon him. It
was the work of an instant to snatch him from his
eminence, to shake and belabor him viciously, pouring
out the while a flood of abuse as eloquently
vituperative as a fertile brain and fluent tongue could
devise, to rush down the garden and with all the
strength inspired by fury to hurl him over the stone
wall. Then, and then only, when her vengeance was
accomplished, did Nanon pause for breath, drawing a
long sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now shall my eyes, even mine, have the consolation
of seeing that valueless saint lying in the dust
shattered into a thousand pieces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a bang which was intended as a further vent
for her distressed feelings, Nanon threw wide open
the side gate leading from the secluded greenery of
the garden into the dusty street. Then she stopped
suddenly as though she had received a shock; the
gleam of triumphant satisfaction faded from her eyes,
her ruddy color turned to gray pallor. The ecclesiastical
authorities would likely view with strong disfavor
any disrespect paid to the saints; some thought
of the consequences of her action began to penetrate
Nanon’s agitated mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking thoughtfully down at the fragments of the
ill-used St. Joseph stood a priest. He was a large,
powerfully-built man, in a narrow collar, long dusty
black coat and three-cornered hat. As she met his
kindly piercing gaze Nanon’s wrath faded, and she
bent her head while he raised his hands with a slight
gesture of benediction before he blessed her. Her
quick feminine intuition taught her that she would
fare much better with this man than if she had fallen
into the hands of the Jesuits. There were few in
Ville Marie but had unqualified faith in the gigantic
soldier priest, Father Dollier de Casson, Superior of
the Seminary of St. Sulpice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what is this? Didst thou imagine, my good
Nanon, that the passers-by were heathen Iroquois,
that thou shouldst assault them by means of the holy
saints?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nanon in the excitement of the moment forgot her
fear and recovered her natural audacity. As she remembered
her grievances her breast shook with great
sobs; for a second the passion struggling in her
throat could find no utterance. At last she broke
forth:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The worthless, deceiving saint! My little noble,
gentle mistress, pure and guileless as the holy saints
themselves, cast aside for any tag of rubbish! Of all
the great and noble ladies whom God has sent into
this world to beautify His creation, to glorify His
name, and for the relief and happiness of their fellow-creatures,
none ever fulfilled the object of the Creator
more perfectly than our demoiselle. Yet, behold that
kite of an Anne, stuck all over with feathers of spite
and hypocrisy, her very look enough to turn milk
sour, and she boasts that she receives of the saints
every favor she demands. And if the saints fail us
what is to become of us poor common people who
have no other protection?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest listened with silent attention to the confused,
vehement recital. He was too thoroughly
versed in the intricacies of human nature not to
readily comprehend the faithful serving-woman’s
meaning. He had himself a passion for duty and
discipline, a genius for command and obedience,
while his whole soul loathed dastards and renegades.
A good Christian, laboring manfully at his calling,
he had made the joys and sorrows, hopes and fears
of his flock his own. In the most cordial fashion he
worked for the people, dogmatized, and stormed at
them, but, however strict to his ideal of duty, he never
lost patience with human frailty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, the good-for-nothing saint! Figure to yourself,
my Father, a neuvena in his honor—never a
word omitted though the poor bones ached and the
eyes were drowsy with sleep—four candles burning
perpetually before his altar, and all of the very best.
Nothing did I grudge if only the little demoiselle
could have her heart’s desire. It was I that took her
from the arms of her dying mother—me, but a slip of
a girl myself—and she has been my charge, my first
thought, ever since.” Here beating her hands together,
Nanon yielded to a new transport of exasperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sulpician cast a keen glance from under the
white eyebrows which contrasted with his hale, sunburned
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Voyons</span>, my daughter. You would desire high
place and favor in this world for Mademoiselle de
Monesthrol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! but yes, my Father,” she replied, coloring
deeply, smoothing down her apron the while with
her shapely brown hands. “Perhaps I have not the
air of it, but I have seen things in my time. The
people here know nothing of all that, but I remember
the life over there in France. It is at the Court of
our lord the King that my demoiselle should shine,
among the great dames and brilliant demoiselles.
Ah! that is what I would have for our little one.
To see all the world admire her state, but with
reverence, be it understood; to walk behind, to see
and to share her glory, to repay the rebuffs we have
received in our fallen fortunes, to hear it whispered
as I pass, ‘There goes Nanon, serving-woman to Her
Grace, Madame la Duchesse de’—— that is as it should
be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A smile of irrepressible humor curved de Casson’s
firm lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou covetest this world’s glory, yet thou wouldst
grudge her high place in the Heavenly Kingdom.
My brave and loyal Nanon, thou wouldst generously
sacrifice much to win happiness for thy mistress. I
also would it were God’s will that the demoiselle
should travel His way by a smooth and sunny road,
but if there is no easier path to heaven, then bless
her in taking that which is offered, my daughter.
The roads leading to perfection are often dark and
thorny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that is what I cannot bear,” sobbed Nanon,
as the priest continued thoughtfully as though thinking
aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To love is to serve. If service and affection are
considered separately, the very essence of love, that
which gives it life, is lost. After all, love, when unselfish,
whether joyous or unfortunate in its results,
must be splendid and lofty.” Then recalling his
attention by an effort he added, “Thy loyal affection,
my good Nanon, is not as wise and tender as
that of thy Master, who knows all things and judges
with clearer eyes than we poor mortals. Thine would
deprive Mademoiselle of the crown and grace of
suffering; His will uphold her amidst the fiery ordeal
of tribulation. See to it, Nanon. Yield the child’s
future up to the care of Him who is the loving
Father of all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clear tones had a sort of inspiring ring in
them; the composed, benevolent countenance was
illumined by the cheering light of faith and courage.
Nanon hung her head. This philosophy, so high and
pure, was beyond her comprehension; what she really
craved was assurance of success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you say is doubtless all true, M. le Superior,
and it has the sound of beautiful language; it is
suited to the quality, of that I am firmly convinced;
but, faith of Nanon Benest, the heavenly glory is too
fine, too far off for such as I. I would rather that
other, me, that I could touch with the hands, and
talk about, and let all the world see. Let Mam’selle
Anne, who is ugly as a spider and cross as an enraged
sheep, keep the first; I grudge it not. If M. le
Superior will but give himself the trouble to consider,
he will certainly perceive that no one thinks of
the little one’s interests but her own poor servant
Nanon. Madam la Marquise made the sacrifice of
all when she left her own country, and it appears
quite natural to her that others should do the same.
The Sieur Le Ber adores Mademoiselle, but keeps
steadily in mind his plans for ennobling his own
family. M. Pierre would have her a saint and a
martyr against her will, and now this English cuckoo
has settled herself comfortably in Mademoiselle’s own
nest in order to pick the feathers from her at her
ease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou wouldst undertake to play the part of Providence,
and without having the means of doing so at
thy disposal. <span class='it'>Va</span>, faithless one, it is well the good
God should take the child’s destiny out of thy rash
and reckless hands. What signifies the mode to him
who goes to glory—the shorter cut from the battle-field
or a little longer way through a world of trouble?
Thy loyal affection will be to thee a crown, but thy
pride will prove a thorn to prick thee to the heart, my
poor girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that the most noble the demoiselle de Monesthrol
could condescend to wed with the son of the
bourgeois Le Ber”—Nanon hastened to qualify her
rash admissions, and to vindicate her feminine right
of having the last word; “but of right he should kneel
humbly at her feet, thankful for a glance or a gracious
word.”</p>

of the colony at one of those late suppers
which had been so severely denounced by the clerical
authorities, but which were so highly enjoyed by the
more worldly portion of the community. The service
of the table was arranged with elaborate magnificence.
Clusters of lights flashed on gold and silver plate.
The banquet consisted of four courses. Chicken soup
was served first; then followed prime legs of mutton
garnished with chops, and choice venison pies whose
pale gold-colored crust was raised in fanciful shapes.
Between the roasts were dishes of plover, woodcock
and partridges roasted on the spit, and strings of
larks served by the half-dozen on the little splinters
of wood upon which they had been cooked. The
third course consisted of entrées, salads, both sweet
and salt, perfumed omelettes, blanc-manges, burnt
creams, fritters and fruit pies. The fourth was dessert,
for which there were fruits piled in pyramids,
cakes, macaroons, march-paine and preserves of various
kinds, the whole accompanied by the fashionable
French wines of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a host, stately, brilliant, imposing, the Governor-General
was at his best. The winning grace that
tempered his strenuous will, the delicate condescension
of his bearing, charmed his guests, as they had
ever the power to bind his own party into devoted
adherence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A last toast before we leave the table: ‘To the
glory of our arms.’ Help yourselves, gentlemen, and
here’s to you,” carrying to his lips a golden goblet
engraved with the family arms, “To the glory of our
arms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guests bowed ceremoniously in acknowledgement,
raising their goblets and repeating, “To the
glory of our arms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room to which the company adjourned was a
long drawing-room with curtains of the finest Turkey
red, embossed with a damask pattern. The high
carved mantel-piece was painted white. There were
rich fauteuils and couches, buhl cabinets and spindle-legged
chairs. On rosewood cabinets, inlaid with
ivory, stood dainty Japanese jars filled with spices
and dried rose-leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The company was as brilliant as beauty and wit
could render it. The fascination and marked individuality
which have made of Frenchwomen a power,
and rendered them an inspiration to the men of their
race, stamped on all around them the impress of their
aptitudes, their graces, their charm. Card-tables were
set out; the older guests played at lasquenet, hombre,
piquet and brélan; the younger members of the party
revelled in charades and <span class='it'>boutrimés</span>, or listened to the
soft strains of the théobe. In this charmed circle
Madame la Marquise reigned like an empress. Diane,
thoroughly in touch with her surroundings, had never
looked more beautiful. From the white and silver
brocade of her robe rose a regal head and neck;
beneath the powdered masses of hair her eyes burned
deeply like violet stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fairest favorite of Versailles cannot compare
with this peerless flower of New France!” declared the
Governor-General, who was considered a connoisseur
in feminine charms. “She has that in her face that
would send men to death as to a banquet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle, will you permit an old man whom
your freshness has made young again to pay his
devoirs? Your father was among my early friends,
as Madame la Marquise will bear me witness.”
Frontenac made a low bow, his palms steadying his
sword, while his spurs clanked and his plumed hat,
held in the right hand, swept the ground. He spoke
the accepted language of gallantry, uttering the
strained courtesies of the Court and high society; but
the homage offered was palpably sincere, and carried
with it a subtle flattery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chevalier de Crisasi held his place at
Mademoiselle de Monesthrol’s side. The Chevalier
was owned body and soul by this girl; there was a
pathetic dignity in his very hopelessness. Even to
hint at his affection, under the present unfortunate
circumstances, would have been so glaring a departure
from French precedent that the courtly gentleman
would have shrunk from attempting it. He could,
however, express many varying meanings with his
eyes, while the rest of his face remained blandly inexpressive;
the most rigid propriety could not deny
him that privilege. The slow veiling of his eyes was
like a silent salutation. Regarding the Chevalier
with attention, Diane, by the aid of that new intuition
which vitalized all her faculties, perceived a change in
the man with whom in high spirits of girlhood she
had carelessly trifled. Is this the misery of sleepless
nights and weary days—the sick craving of a heart at
variance with itself? A swift thrill of misgiving
crossed her mind. Was it possible that her witcheries
had helped to crush one upon whom the hand of misfortune
had already been laid heavily?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she is a Circe, the Demoiselle de Monesthrol,
a superb, magnificent creature whose spells are irresistible;
but, alas! without heart, without soul, like
the coquettes of the Court,” complained d’Ordieux,
who found himself secluded from the circle which
surrounded Diane, and whose views of matters in
general were in consequence somewhat embittered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! softly, my friend, softly, but what a comparison!
Women of the Circe type to me offer no
attraction. I prefer something simple and natural.”
Du Chesne laughed with easy frankness as his eyes
turned to the spot where Lydia sat looking like a
pale blush rose, childishly engrossed with all about
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Simple and natural,’ indeed. How you talk, my
cousin. And who could be more simple and natural
than our Diane? You are blind because you won’t
see,” sharply interrupted Le Ber’s niece, Madame de
St. Rochs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wife and mother at thirteen, the little lady wore
her matronly dignity with exaggerated demureness, or
sometimes in the wild exhilaration of youthful spirits
forgot it altogether. Now, with her piquant, mutinous
face, she looked in her rich costume like some pretty,
mischievous child masquerading in the stately robes
of a grown woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Sainte Dame!</span> who so sweet to the old and the
sick as Diane? who so patient with the little ones?
When my baby—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When that baby’s mother,” mischievously interrupted
du Chesne, his eyes twinkling with fun,
“heartlessly abandoned the poor infant in order to
enjoy the amusement of sliding with the children,
Diane, moved to pity by its desolate condition, doubtless
took the marmot under her protection. Say,
then, is it not so, cousin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, du Chesne. Could you believe so
wicked a falsehood? I went only to see that no harm
befell the little ones, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And were tempted to join in the amusements.
What a situation for a matron of experience!” The
young Canadian delighted in provoking his quick-tempered
cousin. “And the doll, Cecile, that remained
so long hidden in the old oak chest that
Armand, believing it a secret concealed from him,
became wildly jealous. When the baby was ill,
St. Rochs cradled the marmot on one knee and his
wife on the other, singing soothing lullabies to the
two babies at once. Was it not so, Cecile?” persisted
her good-natured tormentor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame de St. Rochs flushed angrily. Tears of
vexation sprang to her eyes, though she made a
determined effort to control herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, then, Cecile, have you heard of the Indian
witch who is camped at the foot of the mountain?”
It was Diane de Monesthrol who came to the little
mother’s relief. “Strange things are told of her. She
is said to have attained a marvellous age, and to be
possessed of extraordinary powers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She foretold the disasters of the Sieur la Salle,”
said Crisasi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us organize a promenade to visit her,” urged
Madame de St. Rochs, who was immediately interested.
“Baptiste Leroux can tell us all about her,
and guide us to where she is to be found. He is as
familiar with the Indian customs as with the five
fingers of his hand. A genuine witch, and the sorcery
practised by the natives is said to be of the worst
possible kind. <span class='it'>Ciel!</span> let us go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, fie! then, Cecile; such vagaries are unfitting
a dignified matron. Your destiny is already settled.
What would you more? A second husband before
you are twenty?” The glimmer of laughter was
shining in du Chesne’s eyes, though his face was
grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rest tranquil, cousin, it is about your fate I would
concern myself. And, oh! there are a thousand
things I would know. If Armand is soon to rise in
the army?—we have indeed need of a larger income—and
Diane? and the Chevalier? and the Sieur
d’Ordieux?—yes, I would know what their fortunes
are to be—and whether those wolves of Iroquois
will end by devouring us all? I would know all.”
Madame de St. Rochs would not include Lydia,
whose beauty and tractability had never won her
favor, and against whom she had conceived a blind
and inveterate prejudice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you so determined to obtain a glance into
futurity, Cecile?” Diane’s eyes sparkled with a
glance of audacious fun. “Lydia will become a nun
of the Congregation of Notre Dame. Cecile will be
a great-grandmother before she is forty. The Chevalier
will receive a command and win honor and
renown. The Sieur d’Ordieux will regain his rights
and appear as a great noble at the Court. Armand
will be a General.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And my cousin du Chesne?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Du Chesne will be Governor-General of New
France, and subdue the Iroquois and discover new
countries for the King,” said Diane, with a momentary
stirring of impatience, quick and vital.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>A</span>S the party came out into the street the flambeaux
of the servants flared wildly against the
solemn sky of night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is against the rules of the Church, this expedition,”
hazarded Lydia, raising the most beauteous
of anxious eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then risk it not,” counselled Madame de St.
Rochs, briskly. “There is always a danger of being
attacked by the savages, but we shall be well protected.
For us, that promenade takes place to-morrow.
Just fancy, a witch who talks to the devil
face to face! It is assuredly a sin, but we will do
ample penance afterwards, and Father Denys is never
severe to those who are contrite for their sins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is but evil to be found with the witch of
the woods and all others of her tribe, I answer to you
for that, Mesdames and Messieurs.” Bras de Fer removed
the pipe from his mouth and gazed around
reflectively at the circle of eager faces. Here, where
he could pose as an authority, he found no difficulty
in expressing his views. “Trust to the experience of
a coureur de bois to whom the silence of the forest has
taught much that is not found in books. Tales of
the most exciting I could tell you of the Lady of
the Iris, whom the redskins call Matshi Skouéou.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us, then, I pray thee, good Baptiste,” implored
Madame de St. Rochs. “It is in such tales we
delight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Matshi Skouéou,” the voyageur began, “is in
alliance with the Evil One, and this witch must be
one of her disciples. Her green eyes possess the
power of fascination, like those of a snake. On her
head she wears a crown of iris flowers, and she is surrounded
by flames of fire. She never appears in the
light of day, but at midnight she descends upon a
moonbeam, and appears in the foam of waterfalls, in
the shadow of dark rocks, or among the mists rising
in the valleys. Her favorite hour is when all nature
reposes, the time when the fire-flies, those spirits of
the lost, dance over the rank marshes; when bats
beat the air with their wings, or cling with sharp, slim
claws to the rocks; when the silence is broken only
by the croaking of frogs and the hou-hou of night
birds. It is then the Matshi Skouéou descends to
gather the iris with which to crown herself and to invoke
the great Manitou.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Children,’ say the old people, and they know
that of which they speak, those old ones; ‘never go
near the river by moonlight. Hidden behind the
rushes the Lady of the Iris watches for her prey;
her voice enthralls the senses, but those upon whom
her glance falls are blighted. Woe to him who falls
into her power.’ No, no, Mesdames and Messieurs,
remain at home and say your prayers; think not of
the witch of the woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This salutary advice, instead of allaying the young
people’s curiosity, served only to increase it. Baptiste,
much against his better judgment, was forced to serve
as guide to the expedition, and the hardy voyageur
uttered the most doleful predictions concerning the
disasters that would surely follow this traffic with
unholy things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far in the heart of the forest stood the solitary
lodge of the Witch of the Woods. The witch herself
was a diminutive old crone, wrinkled and shrivelled
like a mummy, in whom the whole force of a
vigorous vitality was gathered in a pair of luminous
dark eyes. Displaying no surprise at the late hour
which the strangers had chosen for their visit, she
received them with cringing servility, the chief characteristic
of her face being a kind of animal cunning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the merry party found themselves in direct
contact with the consequences of their indiscretion, all
the fun of the enterprise faded away, and only the
undefined sense of terror and mystery remained. In
those days superstition reigned supreme; but at the
same time existence was environed with real dangers of
so many kinds that it required no effort of imagination
to create phantoms of dread. As they stood silently
seeking mutual support and encouragement amidst
the quiet of the forest, a vague sound made itself
heard. At first it was scarcely perceptible, but
growing more distinct, it rose in waves of tender harmony,
and then receded to die away in the distance.
Lydia, frightened and tired, began to cry. Bras de
Fer had drawn his rosary from his pocket, and was
telling over his beads assiduously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The blessed saints will bear me witness that I am
here against my will,” he protested. “Besides that
I am protected by a scapulary and a piece of consecrated
palm against the attacks of evil spirits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the mysterious sounds were resumed, the bushranger
looked up gravely from his prayers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! well, Mesdames and Messieurs, will you now
believe the word of a man who has not gained his
knowledge from books? Midnight, the first night of
the new moon, that unearthly music! <span class='it'>Voilà!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah! that is a seal on the rocks far in the distance,”
responded du Chesne promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon dieu!</span> I fear—I would I had not ventured—I
dare not!” Madame de St. Rochs turned her troubled
childish face towards her companions, her brown eyes
moist with tears, when informed that those who would
penetrate the mysteries of futurity must, one by one,
accompany the witch into still deeper recesses of the
forest. Du Chesne jestingly assured her that as
matron of the party she should set an example of
dignified courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us return, Cecile,” proposed her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young as he was, Armand de St. Rochs had
already given incontestible proofs of gallantry, but he
had no taste for ghostly terrors and would have
avoided them. But the girl-wife’s curiosity still
exceeded her fear; she would not consent to abandon
her project.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Parbleu!</span> that is demanding too much of a lady.
It is the gentlemen’s place to lead the way,” proposed
Crisasi. “I shall be charmed to venture first. Having
little to risk and much to hope—.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And being, as your friends are well aware, a
stranger to fear,” interrupted du Chesne, laying his
hand upon his companion’s shoulder in a friendly
persuasive fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When after an interval the Chevalier returned to
the party his smile was as suave, his tone as bland as
usual. No one would have divined that the Sicilian
had received, and accepted as irrevocable, his death-warrant.
Toward Diane he had gained a new confidence;
his manner was respectful, as became a
gentleman, but he scarcely withdrew his eyes from
her face. The miserable past and doubtful future
were forgotten in the rich flavor of the exquisite
present, intensified now by the conviction of its brief
duration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Du Chesne presently reappeared, looking flushed
and annoyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a cheat! I saw nothing—but the water was
red as blood,” he announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mort diable!</span> I am convinced that no deception
exists.” D’Ordieux shook his perfumed locks excitedly.
“I have had the very happiest predictions,
far exceeding my expectations, which should naturally
be great in a man of my rank—the promise of
realizing my dearest hopes. I entertain no doubt of
its truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we had not been tempted to come. I
shall vow a taper to the Virgin to keep us from
harm,” whispered Madame de St. Rochs to her
husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am persuaded that this is very wicked. I was
induced to consent against my sense of right,” murmured
Lydia, her blue eyes swimming in tears. She
was so deliciously timid and gentle that in his efforts
to reassure her du Chesne was betrayed into several
trifling follies; but her scruples were not sufficiently
urgent to induce her to relinquish her intentions, and
she returned from the interview radiant and flushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had finally come to Diane’s turn. The shade of
the trees was excessively dense, and for an instant the
French girl stood confused by the prevailing obscurity
and the air of unreality in which all things
seemed to be wrapped. Presently she perceived the
witch, with a long wand in her hand, standing before
a fountain of water. She was speaking rapidly in her
native tongue, her voice rising and falling in a weird,
monotonous recitative, a strange fantastic incantation
in which distant voices appeared to join, rendered
more impressive by the perfect stillness of the forest.
She could hear sounding and re-echoing a slow,
solemn chant, dreamy and plaintive, redolent of mystery
and melancholy—long-drawn sighs, the whisper
of angels’ voices, the song of the winds, all those
magical accents that captivate imagination. Then
there was a change. Quick and bright came broken
notes, rising to a mad, reckless gaiety that set the
blood aflame; then mournful melody like the autumn
wind moaning in the branches, deepening and still
deepening; anon rising into the flourish of trumpets
on the battle-field, and ending in a funeral hymn
floating through the dim aisles of some vast cathedral.
It was like the entrance into dream-life, for
those enchanted strains embodied all the extremes of
human joy and suffering, aspiration and yearning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she listened, the witch’s decrepit form expanded,
acquiring size, height and dignity; the crafty, sensual
features gained a strange power and majesty. A
sudden sense of mystery, of dominant and all but
overpowering force, took possession of Diane. Every
thought of her heart, to the very depth of her being,
seemed familiar to this influence and responsive to its
command. She shivered with an excited desperation
of feeling, of mingled desire and apprehension, of
attraction and repulsion. A rich, heavy perfume,
resembling the fragrance of incense, filled the air, and
a thick cloud hung over the large basin of water
which stood before her. Obeying an imperious gesture
of the Indian woman, the girl advanced and bent
over the basin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane’s form grew rigid as she stood with eyes
fixed on the water, their pupils dilated in a terror-stricken
gaze. A light film of pungent smoke arose,
which, wreathing itself in airy circles, seemed to catch
a fiery color from some unseen flame. Then, gradually
crystallizing, it assumed definite form. Was it
a tissue of fancy and reality that produced a creation
so fantastic? Vaguely, as in a dream, she perceived
remote vistas, all weird and mysterious, peopled by
spectral shapes, resounding with far-off, uncertain
footsteps. Then out of the darkness there glided
wavering, shadowy figures, at first faint and indefinite,
then gradually becoming more distinct. Clear as a
reflection in a mirror, every trifling, delicate detail
perceptible, the scene shaped itself before her eager
gaze. It was a spacious apartment; two nuns were
moving softly to and fro about the lofty four-post
bed; wax tapers, in tall curiously-chased silver candlesticks,
shed a softened radiance upon the room.
Lying on the bed, still and stately, like the heroic
statue of some knight asleep upon his tomb, lay a
young man. In the shadow a girl, slender and delicately
formed, knelt upon a <span class='it'>prie-dieu</span>, her head bowed
upon her tightly clasped hands. For a time she
seemed to be looking on some scene that she had
long known and loved, but which had taken on a
new aspect. Then as the flickering, uncertain light
settled into a clearer reflection, Mademoiselle de
Monesthrol asked herself if that aged nun with the
sweet, benign expression did not surely resemble the
venerable Sister Marguerite Bourgeois; and that
other, taller and more active, certainly must be
Sister Berbier, Superior of the Congregation of
Notre Dame. The young man’s features were concealed
from her, but the girlish mourner moved, and
with the listlessness of apathetic suffering turned her
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A horrible paralyzing dread ran shuddering through
Diane’s veins, for that face, haggard, bloodless, convulsed
by inexpressible grief, was her own. Then a
thick cloud of darkness passed between her and the
mystic scene; she was conscious only that the glowing
eyes of the witch were riveted intensely upon her.
When, bewildered, she turned to look again, all had
collapsed like shadows in a dream; the basin of
water alone remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane did not often lose self-command. In this
supreme crisis, when all things seemed to be slipping
away from her, she fought to persuade herself that
what she had seen had been all a creation of her own
imagination. A faint smile, like the palest of winter
sunshine, curved her lips; her hands tightened in a
silent struggle at self-restraint. When she raised her
white face, a proud, confident look shone from her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never yet has it been in the power of danger and
disaster to daunt the spirit of a de Monesthrol.
Others have suffered—I may suffer—yet are we still
in the hands of the good God.” Drawing herself up
with conscious dignity, Diane spoke as though hurling
defiance at some unknown and threatening power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soft sounds of quivering leaves were the only
noises that disturbed the silence of the forest; she
seemed to be surrounded by darkling shadows profound
with fate. The witch crouched low on the
ground, her face hidden in the folds of her blanket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have been guilty of a folly. It is but an idle
jest,” Diane said quietly as she rejoined her companions.
“We can go home now and do penance for
the sin we have committed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that it is over I do not care about our
expedition in the least,” grumbled Madame de St.
Rochs, who was tired and sleepy, and who had not
received the flattering predictions which her youthful
buoyancy of spirit had led her to anticipate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crisasi regarded Mademoiselle de Monesthrol earnestly.
The man who loved her alone perceived that
the girl was stricken, and that, with hand clenched
hard against her heart, she was resolutely striving to
control her throbbing pulses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has, indeed, been tiresome, and not worth the
trouble,” he said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the serene composure of Diane’s outward bearing
as she left the scene there was no trace of the tense
passion and misery that were gnawing at her heart.
She was resolved calmly to face the future, whatever
it might contain.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>That night, as the French girl lay awake, a strange
flash of realization came over her. Panting with pain
and terror, flinging up her hands in the darkness, she
cried desperately:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Virgin! deliver me. That which I never
imagined has come upon me—has conquered me—that
which will never again leave me in peace, all my
life long. Something beautiful and terrible—so terrible!
Holy Virgin! thou hast a woman’s heart—deliver
me from this!”</p>

glad and fragrant, at the caress of the pale
dawn. The rooks clamored in their nests, the fish
rose in the lazy streams, the robins sang plaintively
among the shrubs. Mount Royal, St. Helen’s Island
and the St. Lawrence glowed palpitant in the magical
summer haze. All nature seemed to breathe a spirit
of tranquil peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But despite this calm a dark cloud of alarm hung
over the colony. The air was full of rumors concerning
the expedition which it was confidently alleged
the English were about to direct against Canada.
Priests and traders, nobles and bourgeois, bushrangers,
and red-skinned children of the forest, were content
to forget prejudices and animosities in consideration
of the common interest, and to unite in the extremity
of their peril. Yet through all, the elements of true
Gallic light-heartedness relieved the poignant distress
of the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was plainly understood that the situation of the
colony was most precarious. The garrison of Ville
Marie consisted of but seven or eight hundred soldiers,
and of these many were posted at various points in
the surrounding country to protect the colonists while
gathering in the harvest. It was deemed advisable
to draw in all of these for the protection of the town.
Prolonged echoes reverberated from Mount Royal
and across the St. Lawrence as guns were fired to
recall the troops. Soon they began to arrive, accompanied
by many of the settlers seeking the protection
of the forts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this crisis the clamor of fear and anxiety and
endeavor penetrated even to the cloistered cell where
the recluse, Jeanne Le Ber, strove to shut out all
sign of earth’s joys and sorrows, and to devote herself
to the contemplation of heavenly glories. Yielding
to the urgent entreaties of the Sisters of the Congregation,
Jeanne Le Ber wrote upon a sacred picture
a prayer of her own composing, addressed to the
Virgin. This the nuns caused to be fastened up on
a barn in the country (owned by the community,
and supposed to be peculiarly liable to attack), as a
sort of talisman, to preserve it from harm. This was
Anne Barroy’s hour of triumph; enjoying it to the
fullest extent, her pride swelled to enormous proportions.
At this moment beauty, birth, breeding and
worldly pride could bear no comparison with the
temporal as well as spiritual advantages of superior
holiness. “Our saint” and “that sainted one” were
the mildest terms in which Anne permitted herself to
allude to her cousin, and she never wearied of talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I enter her apartment,” the enthusiast
would declare, with impressive solemnity, “I perceive
in the air a certain odor of sanctity which gives me
the sensation of an agreeable perfume. Truly she
speaks like a seraph and is the companion of angels.
What a blessing to rest beneath a roof which affords
shelter to so perfect a creature, though there may be
those not so far away who fail to appreciate their
privileges.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For me!” cried Nanon with a clatter, “I had no
necessity to travel to Canada to make acquaintance
with saints. We have them at home, and of superior
quality. There was St. Anne d’Auray, Mother of
the Blessed Virgin; and St. Geneviève of Paris, at
whose shrine kings and nobles worshipped; but
indeed, I have no taste for home-made articles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne continued as though she were not aware of
the interruption. She knew that at this moment her
words were eagerly listened to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, our saint accumulates merits against the
day of judgment; those who are wise would strive to
share a small portion of them. From her earliest
years she began the study of perfection; every virtue
was seen and admired in her. It is the country of
saints, this. Behold the head of the martyred Frenchman,
which amazed the Iroquois who had cut it off
by scolding them roundly for their perfidy, and threatening
them with the vengeance of Heaven. Think,
also, of the handkerchief of the late Père la Maître
(may his soul rest in Paradise!) stamped indelibly, as
on a piece of wax, with the features of its former
owner. The heathen Iroquois have ever since been
seen using it as a banner in battle. Should the
country be saved, our deliverance will be due to the
prayers of our sainted one, who has sacrificed herself
as an expiatory offering for Canada.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might I commend myself to the good prayers
of our reverend demoiselle, and particularly to the
sacrifice of the Mass for my intention,” urged Jean
Ameron, with eager subserviency. “And are you
quite persuaded, Mam’selle Anne, that our saint’s
credit with the powers of heaven will be sufficient
to protect Canada from those sorcerers of English?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nanon glared at her adorer, who had so readily
gone over to the enemy, but in his fright his mistress’
ire had no terror for Jean. Anne hastened to reassure
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. Have not the gentlemen of the Seminary
and the blessed Sisters of the Congregation of
Notre Dame given ready testimony to her perfection?
Can you doubt the power of the saints, given them
by the blessed Virgin herself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly not, nor should I dare to presume.
Without doubt it is a convenience to find one’s self
near a holy saint, if she will but remember the needs
of the poor sinners, and exert her credit with all the
heavenly host on our account. Could our sainted
demoiselle be persuaded but to write me a little
word that I might wear with my scapulary to preserve
me from evil fortune? <span class='it'>Voilà</span>, Mam’selle Anne,
if you would have the goodness to remark the fact,
like the demoiselle Le Ber herself I have denied
myself the happiness of matrimony in order to merit
the favor of Heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ta, ta! there are saints and saints, my son, and
thou wouldst place thyself among them. Wilt thou
then dare to compare thyself to that spotless creature,
reverenced by all the world for her holiness, who is
an expiatory offering for the sins of her country, and
not a refuge for cowardly lackeys? Out of my presence!
It is that unruly ostrich Nanon who has
inspired thee with the thought of such impertinence!”
cried Anne with growing fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mam’selle Anne has always reason. Yet doubtless
you will allow that my bones are precious to me,
and that it is a duty to take thought for one’s self,”
whimpered Jean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Jeanne Le Ber’s prayer disappeared, stolen
from the edifice to which it had been attached, to the
consternation of the good Sisters who had trusted
implicitly in its efficacy, no one suspected the immense
solace which Jean derived from having it tucked comfortably
away under his scapulary.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>O</span>NE day scouts coming into the town informed
the Military Governor, M. de Callière, that
Peter Schuyler, with a strong force of English and
Dutch troops, accompanied by Mohawks, Wolves and
Mohegans, was marching on Ville Marie. Rumor
magnified the actual facts to the most exaggerated
proportions. A crowd of anxious people blocked the
streets in every direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it true that the invaders are close at hand?”
asked the baker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But assuredly,” responded the grocer, who in his
haste had forgotten to remove his blue woollen night-cap,
the corner of which dangled rakishly over his
left eye. “It is the English who will make mincemeat
of us. They have sold themselves to the devil,
and bathe themselves in the blood of little children.
I already see us all being devoured.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! my good St. Anne!” cried a young woman,
whose short homespun skirt revealed a trim pair of
ankles. “Can anyone tell if they are numerous,
these sorcerers of English?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Numerous, good woman? <span class='it'>Dame!</span> but like the
sands of the sea. A thousand fire-eaters are close at
hand.” A soldier who happened to be passing amused
himself at the public expense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Javotte! Javotte!” the woman shrieked, waving
her hands excitedly. “Five thousand English are
upon us; we are all to be scalped and taken prisoners
immediately!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This terrifying prediction spread among the populace,
creating consternation which almost amounted
to a panic. Meanwhile energetic preparations for
defence were being made. All the military and most
of the bourgeois were under arms; among the soldiers
appeared old men and young lads who, in
ordinary cases, would have been considered unfit for
service. It had become an absolute necessity that
anyone who could shoulder a musket should lend a
helping hand. Women and children, who at the signal
of alarm had come in from the surrounding country,
were busily occupied in carrying their poor possessions
to the shelter of the citadel or to the convents.
Here an invalid with pale face was carried on a hastily
improvised stretcher; there an old man, anxious
to preserve the poor remnant of life that remained to
him, tottered feebly, leaning on his daughter’s arm;
yonder a young mother, frantic with terror, flying in
search of refuge, bore in her arms a tiny babe, the
little one regarding with true infantile calmness the
unfamiliar scene of tumult and confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make way there, good people, make way!” cried
a stout, robust woman, who was bearing a large blue
wooden chest, into which she had thrown pell-mell
everything she could collect—clothing, furniture and
cooking utensils all huddled together—and which
was so heavy that it seemed a marvel she could move
it at all. “It is hard enough to get along with never
a man’s hand to help, or even to push, without being
blocked up as well. Make way there, I say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make way then yourself, Pétronille,” retorted the
sharp, quivering voice of a tiny, withered old crone,
staggering under the weight of a feather-bed. “Chut!
screech-owl! see to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Allons!</span> Mère Poisson, bite with but one tooth.
Rest tranquil, I pray you. At your age it would
appear more seemly to rest upon your mattress than
to drag it about the streets in the open light of day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your rubbish had better be burnt, it is so
long since those things have touched water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shrewish Pétronille, enraged by the taunt,
roughly jostled her neighbor, who fell against a child
carrying a clock; the glass cracked into splinters,
while a nail, standing out from the chest, tore a
hole in the covering of the mattress, from which, the
feathers escaped, flying out in a cloud. The child
cried, the old woman loudly lamented the catastrophe,
but Pétronille, without even turning her
head, and still dragging her chest, pushed her way
resolutely on.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was decided by the authorities that M. de Callière
should encamp at La Prairie, to be in readiness
to meet Schuyler’s attack, while Valrenne, an officer
of birth and ability, should proceed to Chambly with
one hundred and sixty regulars and Canadians, a
body of Huron and Algonquin converts, and another
band of Algonquin converts from the Ottawa, in order
to intercept any of the English forces which might
chance to come by that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Du Chesne goes in command of the Canadians.”
Jacques Le Ber spoke with a long-drawn sigh, that
seemed to come from the depths of his heart. These
tragic episodes were interruptions to his own serious
interests. More than that, affection for his youngest
son was entwined with the closest fibres of his nature,
and no one recognized the dangers of forest warfare
more clearly than the grave merchant, experienced in
such strife, who himself had ever been ready to serve
his country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are going to lay siege to Paradise, to win it
and enter in, because they are fighting for religion
and the faith.” A sort of passionate insistence contrasted
oddly with the ordinary calm preciseness of
Pierre Le Ber’s level tones. The words fell upon the
father’s ear like a prediction which he resented. He
regarded his eldest son with a mingling of reverence
and impatience, and then turned to seek comfort in
Diane de Monesthrol’s open, steadfast gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is but a plain duty, my uncle; a soldier
belongs to his country. It is an honor that du
Chesne should have been selected. The men adore
him; there is no one who has as much influence with
them as he. How proud we all shall be when he
returns covered with glory.” The liquid voice, speaking
in tones of deepest compassion and tenderness,
penetrated to the core of the man’s scheming, worldly
nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly times may change, my rabbit. Before
now we have been reduced to extremities, and have
found deliverance. It may happen so again. Whichever
way it goes, there is nothing to be done but
make the best of it.” Saying this, Le Ber shrugged
his shoulders with resigned emphasis, though there
were strange nervous twitches about his firm lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane was so young, so buoyant in her hopes, so
high-spirited and high-hearted, that neither fear nor
shadow of disaster could easily crush her. This was
a time of trial, to be lived through as best they could,
but it seemed positive that, after all, things must go
well. With the sweet agitation of hope and delight
dancing in her veins, she felt only elation from the
excitement around her. The spectacle of a courage
absolutely free from egotism was too common among
the devoted Canadian women of the day to attract
much attention. Yet it was with some surprise that
those about saw Mademoiselle de Monesthrol throwing
off the dainty air of stateliness which was considered
becoming to her station, and growing sweet and
womanly in the glory of self-sacrifice. It was difficult
to identify the proud and capricious beauty with the
gentle girl whose watchful eye and helpful hand were
at the service of all, who in a frank, generous fashion
dealt out cheer and sympathy to whoever chanced to
need it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a change I scarcely expected, a new
development,” mused the Marquise, always critical
and philosophical. “Well, the little one comes of a
race born brave and generous.” For an instant the
keen eyes softened, the delicate features quivered,
warm waves of memory rolled over the proud
woman’s soul.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Diane, I must talk with you. I can trust you
entirely.” Du Chesne spoke eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hot wave of color swept over the girl’s face, but
she raised her eyes frankly to the young man’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the careless gladness of his youth du Chesne
was going forth to meet the solemn future, full of
lights and shadows. Nature breathed into his heart
an inarticulate thrill of prophecy, a dark foreboding.
He paused before advancing lightly to meet that
fate, whatever it might be. Grasping the outstretched
slender hands so hard that the pressure hurt the girl,
he gazed at her with a subdued and silent tenderness,
such as he might bestow upon a sister. There was a
shadow of anxious care upon the merry, boyish face
which no one could ever have associated with du
Chesne. He sought assurance and comfort from the
companion of his childhood. As he watched the
moist red lips close firm and sweet above the delicate
chin, he was persuaded that his expectation would
not be disappointed. With a sob of excitement and
agitation swelling in her throat, Diane returned his
gaze. A cry of momentary anguish almost escaped
her, but she scorned herself for the failure of courage,
and forced a smile upon lips that quivered. It was
not weak repining, but encouragement to strengthen
his heart in time of need, that a man had the right
to expect from the woman who loved him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have had too much experience of forest warfare
not to know that I take my life—aye, and carry it
lightly, too—in my hand. A stray shot from behind
a tree”—Diane shivered—“a random blow from a
tomahawk, and all is over. There are things I would
settle in case an accident should befall me. I know
you will be a true daughter to my father, who loves
you as though you were his own. And for Pierre—our
good Pierre,” knitting his brows in perplexity
over a problem to which he had failed to find a
solution, “I don’t know. Things arrange themselves,
Diane; don’t trifle with him, or lose heart, my dear.
I have promised a mass in honor of the good St.
Anne that things may go well with you both, though
I know not how. You have never trusted me as I
mean to trust you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane’s heart suddenly stilled its fluttering, and
sank like lead. Of what interest at this supreme
moment were Pierre’s concerns that they should be
allowed to occupy word or thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have been as brother and sister, truly
attached,—is it not so, Diane? I can remember now
exactly what you looked like when my father arrived
holding you in his arms, saying that you would be
my little companion, and that I must be gentle and
learn to protect you; and I was so proud to have a
little lady for my playmate. You have, indeed, been
a sunbeam in our house. Before we part I would
share my secret with you, knowing I can rely upon
your sympathy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conscious face, with its hot color and drooping
eyes; the air of happy confusion that sat so curiously
upon impetuous, light-hearted du Chesne; the tenderness
that softened the force and boldness of his
features, thrilled the girl who stood beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On my return I shall ask my father’s consent to
make Lydia my wife. Should success attend our
arms it will be a propitious moment to win a hearing,
and I want you to use your influence, which is great,
to plead my cause. My father is ambitious; greatly
as he is attached to me, I am by no means certain
that his sanction will be easily gained. From the
first moment that my eyes rested upon the English
captive I have loved her. All through the winter
before I met her I had passed through toil and
danger and carnage, and then that summer day her
tender presence dawned upon me like some star of
peace and repose. You, too, have been won by her
sweetness. It was together we rescued her, remember,
Diane. I never loved you so dearly as when I
watched your tender care of the helpless stranger cast
upon your mercy. She has the gift of winning all
hearts. For my sake I would ask you to protect and
care for my treasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Du Chesne was so completely engrossed by his
own thoughts and feelings that he paid but slight
attention to his companion. Diane’s rich color had
given place to a strange excited pallor. She looked
at him with the wild, hunted eyes of some desperate
animal at bay. The world was suddenly upheaving
beneath her feet, and her heart stood still as the
keenness and sharpness of the shock crushed the
spirit within her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, Heaven! not later than yesterday she had
been as a queen, graciously dispensing her favors,
smiling tolerantly at Lydia’s petty vanities and weaknesses—Lydia,
who had come into her life as a
stranger, stirring it to its very foundations, robbing it
of peace and happiness, leaving her in return the
blank of a great desolation—Lydia, whom she had
protected and cherished, who owed all to her generosity.
Now a flash of lightning had come out of the
apparently cloudless sky, smiting her from her pedestal,
precipitating her into this awful void in which
every wretchedness was conceivable. Others had not
been as blind as herself. She remembered her aunt’s
sarcasm, the hints Nanon had given her, the ill-will
to the English girl Cecile de St. Rochs had so often
openly expressed. The glare of illumination was
intolerable, bringing with it a galling, insupportable
mortification. As these bitter truths flashed upon
her, Diane clenched her hands, flushing into a sudden
rage of bitter humiliation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Diane, you are surely not surprised? I thought
that you, who are so quick, would have divined my
feeling from the first. I fancied that your kindness
to Lydia was inspired by friendship for me, as well as
delight in her charms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trustful glance of the young man’s frank, eager
eyes melted the fire of pain and rage and jealousy.
A piteous little smile crossed her lips, as though she
were amused at, yet very sorry for, that proud, high-handed
girl who had fancied herself supreme, and
who was none other than her old self. The vehement,
hot-blooded creature was overwhelmed by a
black pall of shame and self-disgust. What did it
matter if the whole world crumbled away, and that
her pride and vanity vanished with it? If du Chesne
sought comfort it must be her place, crowned by the
glory and agony of self-sacrifice, to supply it. No
one could supplant the companion of his childhood in
that office. Turning her resolute face to the future,
without wasting a single thought upon her own
strength or need, she battled against the rush of
strong feeling with a fierce, determined energy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane could scarcely stand, but she confronted the
young Canadian with a brave smile, a dumb denial of
her anguish, and even succeeded in assuming an air
of gaiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did take me by surprise. I had no thought
of this. But I am grateful for your confidence, and
shall try to prove myself worthy. And then, my
cousin, when you return——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, return, who can tell how that will be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paled before a supposition to which he dreaded
to give form even in his thoughts. Together with a
stern sense of his own immediate duty, which was to
put through the work in hand steadily and cheerfully,
without any careful hesitation or speculation concerning
the ultimate ethics of the situation, there existed
in Le Ber’s youngest son much tenderness of heart
towards the weak and unfortunate, and delicate consideration
for friends and kindred, as well as ardent
devotion to the chosen one of his heart. Existence
was full of hope and generous ambition; he was surrounded
by kindly, faithful faces and honest love.
In the strength of his early manhood he was conscious
of stirring hopes and untold possibilities, above
which shone the thought of his girl-love with her
innocent grace and guilelessness. All this was deepened
by that touch of uncertainty that gives exquisite
intensity to affection, and the quickened interest of
tragic possibilities. These fancies were followed by
wiser and sadder thoughts, and immediate practical
considerations. Just as the color grew richer and the
pace faster, and life spread before him a full completeness
he had never even imagined, was it, he
asked himself, to be stained forever by the cruelty of
circumstances? A great wave of sadness, a swift
dread of advancing pain and disaster, the reaction
from his natural buoyancy of temperament, rushed
over du Chesne’s spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somehow, Diane, when I try to picture my return,
I cannot imagine how it will be. Many times before
have I started on such expeditions without a thought;
this time it is entirely different. I cannot help remembering—it
was less than a year ago—St. Helène’s
fate. Then De Clermont, Bienville, De Bellefonds,
De la Motte, were close friends and trusty comrades,
with whom I fought and camped and hunted; where
are they? Gallant gentlemen, they have laid down
their lives, gaily and carelessly, forcing and country.
<span class='it'>Mort dieu!</span> what will you? A day sooner or later
makes but little difference. Shall I make a nightmare
of death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing, evident and definite, seemed to clear
Diane’s dazzled senses—du Chesne had turned to her
for comfort. She held his hand with a strong compelling
pressure which had in it no trace of selfish
sentiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there are others, my cousin, whose duty
compels them constantly to go upon such expeditions,
and who have ever returned unharmed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but to you I do not mind confessing that for
the last few days I have been unnerved by strange
fancies. It is because another’s fate depends upon
my own. It is for her, so young, so tender and
trusting, without protection of friend or relative; at
this thought the heart melts within me, and there is
nothing to be done. Diane, you have ever been
strong and true; you could not fail one who trusts
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strength of one dedicated to a pure and elevated
purpose flamed into Mademoiselle de Monesthrol’s
eyes; all her face grew nobly luminous.
Every word she spoke was crystal clear, coming
straight from the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can trust me, du Chesne. I will be to Lydia
a loving sister; I will place her welfare before my
own. With our Blessed Lady’s help I will be as true
and tender to her as I would be to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In life or death I commit her to your charge.
You have removed my heaviest care.” Du Chesne
bent reverently to kiss the warm hand that clasped
his own. “I shall have perfect peace in trusting to
the loyalty of my brave and tender sister.”</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:.9em;'><span class='it'>PREPARING FOR THE EXPEDITION.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>P</span>IERRE LE BER had lately been occupied in
painting upon a piece of fair white linen a
picture of the Virgin, and this he had embellished
with all the beauties which an ardent imagination
could suggest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ciel!</span>” cried Nanon, regarding the painting attentively,
“It is a beautiful picture, and in truth it
resembles our demoiselle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This speech greatly scandalized Anne Barroy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not sufficient that this proud turkey would
claim for her mistress highest rank on earth; she
would fain push her to the front among the heavenly
host as well,” she whispered to one of her familiars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jeanne Le Ber, who excelled in embroidery, had
made a very beautiful banner for the picture, and it
was decided that this emblem of the protectress of
the settlement should be presented to the war-party
as a safeguard. Recognizing the fact that the panic-stricken
settlers required every available encouragement
that could be derived from both faith and
patriotism, the ecclesiastical authorities organized a
procession, as imposing as the resources of the colony
would allow, to carry the flag to the Parish Church
of Notre Dame, where it was to be consecrated by
Dollier de Casson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The church was a spacious building. Above the
great altar, blazing with lights, rose an immense
wooden image of our Saviour suspended on the
cross. Behind it the dim glories of the choir deepened
into golden gloom. From the lofty rood screen
dark shadows, thrown by the lights of distant altars,
brooded over the space beyond. At the head of the
church, near the chancel, was placed a <span class='it'>prie-dieu</span> for the
Governor of Ville Marie, who was surrounded by a
brilliant group of officers. Soldiers thronged the side
aisles, and all the intervening space was occupied by
the confused movement of the throng of spectators.
The eager faces of all turned toward the high altar,
with the banner displayed before it, as though therein
lay their only hope. Wistful women, scarcely able
to restrain their streaming tears, or wrapt in the heroism
of some higher purpose, gazed, hushed and awed,
upon the little band of heroes who for faith and
country were willing to face danger and risk life
itself. Tears came to haggard eyes looking upon the
flag. Patriotism was an inspiring principle, faith a
fervent flame, to those who had already made great
sacrifices for religion and country; there was even a
thrill of sweetness in the thought of dying for it. A
fine and simple courage sustained many a sinking
spirit, and in the contagion of popular enthusiasm
there was but slight betrayal of individual weakness.
Many were moved to an almost passionate exhilaration
by the martial music, while others were overcome
by the pathos of the brave show, with its implied
possibilities of horror, agony and death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The service proceeded with intoning of litanies and
chanting of psalms. From a grated gallery, beyond
the obscurity of the screen and crucifix, floated the
delicate harmony of sweet voices in wave after wave
of soft melody, like the measured refrain of an
angelic choir, echoes of an eternal voice speaking
to the human soul. The choir intoned the <span class='it'>libera</span>,
and when the concluding words of the last verse
died away in the arched roof, a woman’s voice, clear,
pure and penetratingly sweet, arose in the miseremine:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Miseremine mei, miseremine mei saltem vos amici
mei. De profundis clamavi ad te, Domine, Domine
exaudi vocem meam.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the deepness of her human anguish, from the
longing for strength to sustain a wounded spirit and
fainting flesh, Diane de Monesthrol repeated:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out of the depths I cry unto Thee, oh, my God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had come to realize that for herself nothing
remained but an absolute, solitary and sorrowful
renunciation; but this was no time for indulgence in
sinking of heart or depression of soul. Some spirit
stronger than herself took hold of her, giving her the
look of an embodied passion, beautiful but terrible.
Her figure and her whole attitude were instinct with
resolution; every word and movement was vitalized
by an inspiration. Her face was full of vehement
life—eyes kindling, cheeks flushed, lips trembling,
nostrils quivering. Led by some subtle intuition,
timid souls crept near her for comfort and support.
If an impatient expression broke from her unawares,
she quickly controlled herself, and followed it with
words of hope and consolation. Suffering was so
new to her that any sort of exertion seemed preferable
to passive endurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t leave me, Diane; you inspire me with
courage. Oh! it is fine to be brave and strong as
you; but then you are not risking your heart’s
dearest; and you, who laugh at men’s follies, and
despise their sentiment, you have never known what
it is to give your heart to one alone. Hold me
fast, then, Diane; let me feel you close when the time
comes to look my last on Armand’s face—perhaps for
ever. Oh! I dare not allow myself to think of that
possibility. I am a soldier’s wife; do not let me
forget it. I promised him to be brave, though my
heart should break with the effort; he must not see
me fail,” whispered little Madame de St. Rochs, all
her childish features quivering in the effort to restrain
her grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Cecile, your gallant soldier may be proud of
your courage. You will do your best to strengthen
his heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old woman, with two weeping children clutching
frantically at the skirts of her gown, paused in
mumbling her rosary as Diane passed, and held up
her withered hands imploringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mademoiselle! it is Pierrot, my youngest, the
father of these helpless little ones, who goes with the
expedition. Their mother died at Easter. If anything
happens to him they have but me to look to;
and in these expeditions each man has his share, big
or little, according to the size of the cake—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is to fight for his country, my poor Mère
Bernichou.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His country—but yes, they all say their skin
belongs to themselves, and they must dispose of it to
their taste; but when the men are killed what is to
become of the old people and the babies, I ask you
that? Three of Pierrot’s brothers went the same
way, but not one ever returned. He is as strong as
 a lion, and he worked for us so well. Oh, my good
and noble demoiselle! you are of those who are
listened to by the Blessed Virgin and the holy saints;
pray for us, I implore you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia, the tears running down her pretty, piteous
face, with so sad a curve of lips that seemed made for
smiles, so wistful a glance in the swimming blue eyes,
made no effort to control her sorrowful consternation.
Trembling and shivering she clung to her friend’s
arm, and Diane was able to soothe her as a generous
woman in her tribulation may seek to console a creature
more dependent than herself. She could even
keep in mind the fact that, though weak and frivolous,
Lydia had proved herself neither base nor deliberately
treacherous; and she tried loyally to remember
that in every kindness she offered the English girl
she was lightening du Chesne’s burden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the crowd surged out from the church and
flocked down to the beach, the scene was a bright
and varied one. The St. Lawrence stretched out like
a great mirror under the blaze of sunshine, reflecting
every floating cloud above. St. Helen’s, with banks
of velvet softness, arose out of this liquid light; the
Mountain was varied with a hundred restless rays
playing upon secluded slopes and woody hollows.
The summer sun gleamed brightly upon bayonets
and naked swords, and shone on the rich costumes
of the gallant French officers, whose nodding plumes
shaded hats adorned with gold, and whose lace
ruffles, sashes and sword-knots made a brave show.
Some of the regulars wore light armor, while the
Canadians were in plain attire of coarse cloth
and buckskin, their provisions strapped on their
backs. Much rivalry existed between the latter and
the French. The Canadians had adopted the Indian
mode of fighting, while the Frenchmen, accustomed
only to civilized warfare, found it difficult to adapt
themselves to the methods of the savages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the soldiers walked, with a solemn dignity
befitting the occasion, the dog which was inscribed
on the regimental list as M. de Niagara, and to whom
regular rations were granted. The progeny of a dog
named Vingt Sols, who had done good service at the
fort of Niagara, where he was held in high esteem,
this animal had been brought from that place by M.
de Bergères and taken to Chambly, where his master
served as commandant. As the roads leading to this
post were often blocked by Iroquois war parties, it
was found extremely difficult to send or receive news
from Montreal. At this critical juncture M. de Niagara
solved the problem of how despatches might be
conveyed. It was noticed by the garrison at Chambly
that the dog found his way of his own accord to La
Prairie de la Madeleine. Fearing that some of the
French with whom he had started had been captured
by their enemies, a letter was written and fastened to
the animal’s collar, and he was driven out of the fort.
He at once took the road whence he had come.
Reaching Chambly, the despatch was read, and, with
an answer tied to his collar, the dog was sent off
again. Thus communication was established between
the two posts, and many a life saved. M. de Niagara
always took part in reviews, was profoundly conscious
of his own importance, and was regarded by the soldiers
with the greatest affection as a true and staunch
comrade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A corporal drummer, escorted by two armed soldiers,
marched through the streets beating a rhythmic
movement, which, joined with the shrill notes of a fife,
thrilled the nerves, while the air resounded with the
deep clamor of bells mingling with the fantastic cries
of the Indians and bushrangers. The condition of
things was so precarious that a courage born of desperation
inspired the colonists. “In order to breathe,”
they assured one another, “one must hope.” It was
hard to realize grim possibilities of death and disaster
amidst sunshine and music and movement. After
all, if the worst were to come, it was better to enjoy
the present moment. The spirit of adventure had
already made itself felt in the French blood, a rapid
current wonderfully susceptible to elation. A wild
gaiety began to exhibit itself. Not to be subdued by
an emergency, certain lively youths could be heard
shouting hilariously to one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I lost my tobacco pouch,” cried Bras de Fer, to
whom the prospect of action had restored a comfortable
spirit of self-assertion; “one quite new, too,
made out of the skin of a little seal that I killed on
the Island of M. de St. Helène last year. Ah! if one
of those English wizards falls into my claws, and I
don’t succeed in making a better pouch out of his
skin, may I be scalped before All Saints. The fox
counts on eating the goose, but there are occasions
when things turn the other way; then it is the goose
who gets a chance at the fox. Our hearts are in this
affair, and that is something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is impossible to content all the world and his
father,” grumbled an old soldier, “or to take time to
enquire what his servants, his ass or his ox may
think about. For my part, I enjoy these little skirmishes;
they give a spice of variety to life. I don’t
want to spend my days telling stories in the chimney
corner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My little brother Jaquot, a true imp of the devil,
who is only thirteen and can manage the arquebus
like a man, says, ‘It’s the season for plums, and truly
we will make them eat the stones.’ No fear but we
shall turn out all right. Our captain is brave as the
King’s sword; no one need fear to follow his lead.
After all, I like better to kill the devil than to permit
him to kill me. But pardon, my commandant,”—Baptiste
took the freedom of an old and trusted servant—“Pardon,
but it is an evil day to start on an
expedition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why, pray, Master Bras de Fer? What are
you croaking about there, old bird of ill-omen?” All
shade of melancholy had passed from du Chesne’s
spirit as soon as practical affairs required his attention.
His face was now all alight with martial excitement.
Amidst the cheerful sounds of human bustle
and movement his spirits rose to any height of
adventure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is not to-day Friday? Don’t laugh, my commandant;
we don’t learn these things from books,
they are what we see and know; every chance counts.
The day of ill-omen, I would it were another day we
were starting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah! old wives’ tales,” du Chesne laughed merrily.
“You will never give a thought to that when once the
fight begins. Let me hear no more such nonsense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bras de Fer shook his head in solemn disapprobation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A closed mouth never swallows flies. I might
have spared my breath. To think that I carried him
in my arms and taught him to shoot! The Lord
send me plenty such commandants, there are not
many like him; but Friday—I like it not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a rage for searching noon at fourteen
o’clock, my poor Bras de Fer,” remonstrated the old
soldier. “<span class='it'>Saccagé—Chien!</span> I have heard that spoken
of—the ill-luck of starting on Friday—but once let us
come in sight of those English and we shall think of
neither A nor B.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>N</span>ANON, who for the last few days had been as
restless as an unquiet spirit, had followed her
mistress down to the beach, and now stood close at
hand, watching the preparations for departure which
were being energetically carried on. She found herself
in a position antagonistic to all her former instincts.
Those about her were so completely engrossed
by their own concerns that no one remarked how
greatly Nanon had changed in the last few days.
The Frenchwoman’s rich brown complexion had
turned to dark chalk color; her cap, usually poised
so coquettishly, was pushed carelessly to the extreme
corner of her head; the crushed lappets hung limp
over her shoulders, her cheeks had lost their rounded
contour, her eyes were red and swollen with crying.
A rueful sense of loss was troubling her, and she had
even ceased to care whether Anne Barroy suspected
the cause of her affliction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it for her sins that poor Nanon is taking
thought, or is it the men who are pleased to go that
she is weeping for?” Anne had whispered to a crony,
taking care that her voice should be quite loud
enough to be overheard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The malicious words revived Nanon’s spirit. As
she spoke there was a blaze of fiery agitation, and a
light of pain flashed through the moisture in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is for the brave men going to their death
that I am crying. I am not ashamed of being soft-hearted;
if there were more like me it would be to
their credit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The poor Nanon! she fears that she may be left
to make <span class='it'>la tire</span> on the feast of St. Catharine.”<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Baptiste, smoking his pipe in silence, eyed Nanon
reflectively. He was very slow, but he was very sure,
and an heroic resolve was gradually assuming definite
proportions in his mind. Things could not continue
as they had been; any change was better than that.
He meditated upon his long, hopeless passion. When
did it begin? He could not decide that; it seemed
always to have dominated him. Away in the forest,
amidst toil, hardship and privation, when he thought
of home, it was Nanon’s saucy face that smiled upon
him. He thought upon all the wit and sparkling
vivacity that rendered his cruel love charming, the
oppressive thraldom in which she had held him, the
burning pains of jealousy which he had endured. No
one knew better the dangers of an expedition such as
that upon which he and his comrades were starting,
and none dreaded them less than Baptiste Leroux.
But the thought that he might never again see Nanon
confused and depressed his mind; happily it also
inspired the great simple fellow with a more desperate
courage than any required to resist the attacks of
English or Iroquois, or to die in defence of his
country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the last of all trades—a coward,” he said
to himself. “My principle has always been to conduct
matters by beat of drum. After all, I can be in
no worse condition than I am now; so here goes,
even if I pay through the nose for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stretched out his strong right arm, quietly took
possession of his coquettish mistress,—who appeared
to be so entirely taken by surprise that she made no
attempt to offer resistance—enveloped her in a great
bear’s hug, kissed her once, twice, a dozen times, then
recovering himself, loosened his hold. Realizing the
enormity of his offence he stood humbled and contrite,
with bowed head, to receive the punishment of
his audacity. He could conceive no idea of what
form the tempest which was about to break upon his
devoted head was to assume, but even the noisiest
clamor of Nanon’s sharp tongue would be less terrible
to bear than this breathless silence. Feeling that he
could no longer endure the suspense, he burst out
impetuously:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not care, I could not help it; you may be
enraged if it pleases you; in truth, I could no longer
contain myself. Any good woman would have some
pity on a poor fellow.” Words were scarce with Bras
de Fer, but now he was fairly started, the sound of
his own eloquence delighted him, and he continued
boldly, “If to-morrow I am to be scalped, or thrown
into the Iroquois kettle—and either may likely happen—I
shall have had the satisfaction of feeling what
it would be like if you were really my own girl, who
would welcome me back if I should be so lucky as to
escape tomahawk and bullet, and who would mourn
for me should I fall.” The light of a strong love
illumined his brave, honest face as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was still silence. It was hard that at such a
moment she should remain obdurate. His heart
swelled to bursting; she must be altogether heartless.
Bras de Fer at last found courage to steal an anxious,
imploring glance in the direction of his sweet tormentor.
Nanon stood still as a statue; the warm
tears were streaming down her cheeks, but a strangely
happy smile lingered about her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please, Master Baptiste Bras de Fer, but it
is an innocent one may eat with salt, your Canadian.”
The color had returned to the girl’s cheek, the sparkle
to her eye. “Your wits have long been wool gathering;
say, then, is it possible that you have found them
at last? Did you expect the women to make love to
you, my fine big fellow?”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Du Chesne had drawn Lydia apart from the crowd.
The girl made no effort to control herself; sobbing
convulsively, she clung to him as, taking her hands in
his, his eyes went slowly over her from head to foot.
He was silent, as one who, looking for the last time
on a face he loves, would carry the memory of it with
him to the wide world’s end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay! Give the expedition up; let the others go.
What does it matter? Even if the English come
here, I may find friends among them. Do not leave
me; the parting will kill me,” she entreated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Canadian shook his head. He scarcely
understood her thought, or grasped the idea that she
should dream of placing herself between him and his
duty. A low, pitiful wail, like that of some helpless
creature in distress, stole unawares from her quivering
lips. Du Chesne shivered, and looked around fearfully.
In all his life he had never endured torture
like this; great drops of moisture gathered on his
brow. Could courage desert him now? It was
Diane who, rousing her dauntless spirit with courage
that affection alone could give, came to his aid. She
had reached the highest manifestation of human
passion—self-sacrifice—and was learning that the
soul can be taught to bear pain as the saints taught
their bodies to bear the rigors of hardship and
self-mortification. She was like a soldier who must
fight till the last gasp, who must bear every blow like
a stoic, so long as there was any excuse for the
conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They call you, du Chesne; leave Lydia to my
care. The Blessed Virgin protect you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An expression of sharp anguish for a moment
marred the composure of his countenance. A quick
breath escaped him, half groan, half sob; one long,
lingering look, and he was gone.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>P</span>IERRE LE BER and de Crisasi were standing
side by side; the Chevalier was also to form
one of the expedition. As Diane looked at the two
men she was conscious of a pang of keen self-reproach.
Had her girlish levity and thoughtlessness
indeed made havoc of their lives? Her imagination
endowed them with the pathos of her own suffering.
Pierre was thin and haggard. He had drifted far
from that state of acquiescent contemplation, passionless
and impersonal, destitute of either desire or
movement, which in the estimation of the mystic
constitutes the highest conception of enduring bliss.
A dreadful tension of resistance, a dim anguish of
fear and impotence, had him in possession. His
passion blinded him, but it could not stifle the
abhorrence of the chains which bound him, nor
could it restore his self-esteem. He seemed to have
fallen to the lowest depths, yet this despairing dream
was more exquisite than any of his mystical visions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Crisasi, on the contrary, in the perfection of his
high breeding, was even blander and more courtly
than ever. He was a strong man, who could calmly
set self aside and rise above the sensations of the
hour. The Indian witch’s prediction, in his opinion,
had settled the whole affair. He had received his
death-warrant, and since all was so soon to be over, it
was really not worth while to trouble about mundane
matters. Life had been hard of late years, and this
very conflict would likely end all. He had always
desired a soldier’s death; he had a soldier’s simple
faith, too, in the duty of obedience, courage and discipline,
and made no question that fate had dealt hardly
with him. As Diane’s glance met his, over her whole
frame there came a tremulous fluttering of apprehension,
as though beneath the warmth of true affection
her self-control were breaking; something inexpressibly
touching came into her eyes. That look overcame
the man who loved her. De Crisasi removed
his hat, and bowed profoundly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. de Chevalier,” the girl exclaimed impulsively,
“let me wish you God-speed. My prayers shall
follow you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His heart leaped into his throat. Could it be
possible that his devotion had won its reward, that
the twilight of life should be gilded by a ray of vivid
sunshine? Then he smiled at the absurdity of his
own fancy. Two great hot tears, that scorched like
fire, gathered in Mademoiselle de Monesthrol’s eyes,
and fell upon her cheeks unheeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. Le Chevalier, my cousin du Chesne carries
with him all our hopes, especially those of my uncle
and my poor Lydia. If it should happen to be in
your power to shield him from danger, I know we
can rely upon you, our friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sicilian had given this girl the best love of his
heart, yet their acquaintance had been at best but a
formal one. His fancy had endowed her with many
high qualities, but never before had he realized her
tenderness and simple womanliness. He spoke in a
low, moved tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The confidence with which you have honored me,
Mademoiselle, shall not be in vain. It is a soldier’s
fate to die with fortitude and resignation, professing
the fate of a Christian. Du Chesne is my valued
friend and comrade; if any act of mine can avail to
help him, to bring him back to those who love him,
you can trust to me. The prayers of such as you,
Mademoiselle, must ever be heard in heaven.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Diane, hold up the little one, high, there, that his
father’s last look may rest upon his face. I can no
longer see,” pleaded Madame de St. Rochs, “and
Armand must not see me weep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Diane, I can’t bear it, I am fainting; take me
home.” Sobbing and quivering, Lydia clung to her
friend. “I am afraid of the Indians and the noise.
Oh! let us go away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For our Blessed Lady’s sake try to comfort her,”
were du Chesne’s parting words. “She is only a child,
sensitive and tender-hearted, and it is I who have
brought this sorrow upon her. For my sake be good
to her, Diane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he looked upon his youngest son, Jacques Le
Ber grasped his ward’s arm. He spoke almost
sternly. The strong muscles about his mouth quivered,
though the facial lines did not lose their firm
expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A soft golden haze, obscuring the view of the
opposite shore, lay upon the river, sweeping on in
subdued silvery tints. The Indians manned the large
elm-bark canoes, their paddles cleaving the sunshine
and dimpling the waters of the river. The savage
voices arose in a wild tumult of resounding yells; the
soldiers cheered lustily; a sharp wailing cry resounded
from the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The agony of parting, the strain and stress of the
hour at last over, du Chesne stood erect in the bow
of his canoe. His handsome young face, eager and
animated with the excitement of adventure, bore no
trace of grief or care or doubt; in the relief afforded
by action all dark forebodings had sunk into the
background. As the boats vanished from the tear-dimmed
eyes that watched the last gleam of the
receding oars, the strains of a stirring chorus resounded
across the wave—</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>L</span>E BER stood alone in the world, though surrounded
by family ties and dependents. His
individuality was so marked and striking that he had
few close friends, though his commercial interests
bound him to many associates. During this period
of anxiety old griefs, seared over by time and distance,
acquired fresh vitality to sting. Pierre, in his
feverish unrest, had betaken himself to the hospital
to pray; but it was not so much the fate of the
colony, or anxiety for his brother’s welfare, that
troubled Le Ber’s eldest son, as consternation concerning
his own individual shortcomings. His sister
was as remote from her father as though she had
already attained that heaven which was the object
of her thoughts and prayers. The merchant’s spirit
fainted for sore need of human help, human nearness.
In this emergency it was the stranger that he had
sheltered who clasped his hand, whispering bright
words of cheer and encouragement, ever ready to
offer sweet and gracious sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must learn to be brave, as becomes a soldier’s
bride, my sweet one,” du Chesne had exhorted Lydia.
But the girl had no qualifications for ripening and
mellowing under the influence of any searching mental
experience. The atmosphere was antagonistic;
she hated pain, longed for brightness, pined for sunshine.
She was peevish and nervous, and had no
idea of self-command; nor could she understand how
it was that all the world was not absorbed in her
affliction. That soft, flattering aspect of life in which
she had delighted seemed to be receding from her.
Diane’s patience with her moods was unfailing, yet
there was something about the French girl that awed
Lydia and held her at a distance. Le Ber, who had
conceived some suspicion that his long-dreamed-of
plans for an alliance with the de Monesthrols might
be frustrated by the presence of the English captive,
looked upon her with cold disapproval. Whenever
she dared, Nanon, whose sense of exasperation had
reached fever point, jeered and flouted at the blonde
beauty. Madame la Marquise, who had had excellent
occasion for weeping bitterly many times in her
life, declared that these ceaseless tears gave her the
<span class='it'>migraine</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will retire to your chamber, my daughter,” the
Marquise commanded, with a disdainful condescension
which was not unkindly, looking down at the swollen,
tear-stained face with a serene surprise, too elevated
to partake of the nature of disgust. “You will have
<span class='it'>tisane</span> for the sick—I have already commanded Nanon
to prepare it—you will say your prayers and remain
in seclusion. Where there are many anxious hearts
we need cheer. There will be time for tears and
lamentation when hope no longer exists, although
even then I cannot see that lamentation is of use to
ourselves or others. When the men are ready to give
their lives for their faith and their country, it is the
women’s part to nerve and encourage them; what
are our pitiful weaknesses that they should stand in
the way of our duty? It is the right of the nobles to
submit to the decrees of Providence, to subdue the
body, to show ourselves models of cheerfulness and
resignation, that the more ignorant may learn to
follow our example. But why talk or reason with
those who have no ears to hear and no spirit to learn
the lesson? Therefore, my kitten, retire to your own
apartment, where, at least, you will have no chance of
afflicting others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be admitted that the Marquise de Monesthrol
was given to contemplating calamities with a
courage which appeared overwhelming to less undaunted
spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame de St. Rochs, unable to endure the loneliness
of her own home, determined to take up her
abode at Le Ber’s. She came rushing in impetuously,
white, cold, and shivering, in the midst of the August
heat, clasping the baby and a bundle, which seemed
all one, so closely were they held. The childish
creature threw herself at Diane’s feet, clutching her
friend’s knees, still grasping the bundle and the little
waxen baby, who never seemed alarmed, in the other
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot keep up alone any longer, and I am
ashamed to let the others see me grieve. Let me be
quiet—hide me, and don’t let anybody look at me.
Diane, tell me how I can live till news comes. I have
fearful dreams; I cannot be strong like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the first touch of sorrow these children think
they will die,” mused the Marquise. “Ah! life were
very simple could it end when it becomes unendurable.
No; poor little Cecile, who is not without
courage in her childish way, will live through it all,
and will learn to suffer like a woman in the passion
and patience of silence. But it is harder for those
older, who, while feeling the wound, know that time
will heal, and yet know that a look, a touch, a tone,
will have power at any moment to revive the old
agony till life ends. The happy delusions of youth
find no resurrection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the soothing influence of Diane’s consoling
presence, the baby wife succeeded in recovering her
courage. As her spirits rose in transient reaction
against the despondency which had crushed her, the
absurd, hapless child committed a hundred extravagances.
She chattered and laughed, played wild
games with the baby and Nanon—pastimes which
were at any moment in danger of being interrupted
by vehement thunderstorms of despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our good friend Le Ber has afforded us protection;
it is but right that we should share his anxiety,”
decided the Marquise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame de Monesthrol’s reception-room was continually
thronged by women whose gaiety was almost
reckless in its exuberance; but there remained an
intent, listening look upon the vivacious French faces
and sobs often struggled up surreptitiously amidst the
laughter. While awaiting the decision of all those
tremulous doubts and fears, they bravely endured the
dreadful anxiety with which those shiver and burn
whose strongest hopes hang in the balance. After
all, most of these sorely tried people experienced a
sort of desperate trust in circumstances; and the fact
that duty was the thing to be considered, and not
anybody’s feelings, was cheerfully recognized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the demoiselle de Monesthrol, the old order of
things had been completely overthrown. Deprived
of affection and close sympathy, she was still looking
out upon a world not realized, a bewildered
spectator of something like the throes of creation,
seeing the new landscape tumble and roll into place,
the heights and hollows changing. Those about her
had their own engrossing anxieties; no one thought
of her save as a friendly and disinterested sympathizer.
Whatever she endured she endured alone.
Yet between every pang of heart sickness there intervened
bright glimpses of wayward sunshine, stirrings
of fresh, uncontrollable hope. Reserve forces of
strength, hitherto unsuspected, developed under the
strain of silent endurance. Only a supreme resolve
could have steadied her nerves, calmed the fluttering
pulses, and preserved self-command. An expression
of collected strength that was becoming habitual, and
that during life was never again to leave it, settled
upon Diane’s face. These few days had made the
change of years. Her brow was contracted with
lines hitherto unknown to its broad serenity, her eyes
looked out eagerly from lids that had grown curved
with anxiety, her mouth was drawn and colorless.
Through all she tried to remind herself that God was
still in heaven, faith and mercy on earth; the joy of
her youth had withered, but duty must teach her to
be wise and strong and courageous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blessed Mother of Sorrow, help me to bear
through this hour—help me to endure the burden for
half a day—let my strength hold out till night,”
prayed Diane de Monesthrol.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HE long anxious days that followed the departure
of the troops, with little occupation save
that of watching and waiting, with endless dreadful
suggestions of what might be happening, were a severe
ordeal to the whole settlement. It seemed as though
a trifle might turn the balance—might mean ruin,
total destruction of all hopes and plans, or, on the
other hand, afford the blessed sweetness of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Diane the flame of suffering burned so fiercely
that it permitted no rest. She could allow herself to
look neither backward nor forward. Suddenly swept
out of the joy of her youth into circumstances so
desperate—waiting, dumb and steadfast, before the
necessity which could not be resisted—there were
moments of wild rebellion of spirit, paroxysms of
impatience with life and its complications, a longing
to escape this restless wretchedness, which was
almost unbearable, alternating with brief, ecstatic
moments of complete self-renunciation. What was
the strength of her womanhood good for, the French
girl asked herself, if not to teach her to tread with
calm fortitude those dark paths which seem to be the
only way to heaven; if not to afford solace to those
dependent upon her ministries, to lead her to endure,
with high heart and constancy, the buffets of fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three days had passed, and yet to Ville Marie, waiting
in anxiety, no news had come. M. de Valrenne
had promised to send a messenger directly he could
secure any tidings of the enemy’s movements, and
many regarded this prolonged silence as ominous
of disaster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night of the third day was oppressively warm;
the landscape lay wrapped in a soft incense-breathing
obscurity. The feverish excitement tingling in Diane
de Monesthrol’s veins drove away all thought of sleep.
Suspense imparted an unnatural keenness to all her
faculties, imagination was stimulated to the highest
point, fears and fancies thronged her excited brain.
Her pulses leapt with a prescient thrill of some blow
about to fall. She was convinced that a supreme
crisis had arrived, the endurance of which would tax
her strength to the utmost. It seemed as though, in
the midst of her gay and fearless career, she had been
caught in the gigantic iron hand of a ruthless Fate
that could not fail to crush her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly her whole being seemed to contract and
shiver, with a nameless agony of apprehension. She
could no longer endure the house, which seemed to
stifle her; perhaps the cool night air might relieve this
overpowering horror. Breathless, trembling, she
rushed out into the garden. Over Mount Royal
the moon was shining in a cloudless sky, its sheen
lighting up the tin roof of Notre Dame until it shone
like silver, illuminating the dark foliage of the quaint
garden, and driving its lances of pearly light through
the close-woven branches. Beneath the shade a sort
of mystic twilight prevailed; the dim trees rose in soft
undulations half veiled in the faint and dreamy light.
In the silent hush of nature the dew fell like a benediction;
all the breathings of night were suggestive
of peace and balm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane moved amidst the familiar scene with a
dazed and bewildered consciousness that made all her
surroundings appear like the dim reality of a dream.
This ethereal twilight, with its pale, ineffable clearness,
seemed to be the hour of tender reveries, of delicate
visions. She heard, without heeding, a hundred
crackling sounds—echoes, movements, the rustling
of leaves, the occasional twittering of some bird disturbed
in its nest. A depression deep and dark, the
inevitable reaction succeeding a long strain of agitation,
took possession of her. The feverish energy
which had until now sustained her gave out, and with
the physical exhaustion came the mental. All the
pain and trouble of the last few days became focused
into a haunting fear. It was one of those times when
it seems possible for a human being to stand outside
of material things; when the veil which hides the
everlasting verities is raised before eyes all pained
and strained with gazing. The windows of Jeanne
Le Ber’s room, overlooking the garden, stood wide
open to the summer breeze. An overwhelming impulse
moved Diane. No longer able to stifle the cry
of her anguish, she sank on her knees, stretching out
imploring, passionate hands. Was it the moonlight,
or the play of her own fancy, or did a slight, wasted
form appear at the window, dreamily indistinct in the
prevailing obscurity? Had the urgency of human
need torn the saint from her prayers and her vigils?
The girl’s voice, clear and penetrating, echoed through
the stillness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you, far away there, no feeling for our
trouble? Even in the bliss of heaven itself it seems
as though one’s heart must be touched by love and
grief and pain. You have sacrificed yourself for the
country—cannot you help your own in their extremity?
Du Chesne—he is your brother, if you can
recall the ties of kindred where you are—du Chesne
may be grievously wounded; he may even now be
lying still in death. Have you ceased to hear, to
feel? Does no woman’s heart beat in your breast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did a white face, with deep-sunken, haggard eyes
look down upon her from the window—a face more
like that of a dead woman than a living one? It
seemed to the excited girl, driven to extremities by
her own fancy as much as by stress of circumstances,
that her cry fell upon a passionless, unseen world
which returned no answer. There was a blighting
silence, like a conscious death. A heavy, dull despair
settled upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are all alike, St. Joseph and the saints; you
are content with your own goodness, and are dead
and deaf and dumb concerning the claims of earth;
but we others are only flesh, our hearts throb and
bleed and burn; we cannot keep silent. Du Chesne
is nothing to me but my old playmate, the companion
of my childhood; I have no claim upon him, he owes
me no duty—he never even guessed that I cared for
him. I merit suffering, I who dealt it out to others,
but why should he pay the penalty for my fault? I
have been pitiless, though I never meant it; the good
God may well be pitiless to me, but not to him, not
to him. If I could only tell the Chevalier that I
repent; I never thought my coquetry meant suffering,
I regarded playing at love as a light jest.” Diane
detailed her misdeeds in a voice of anguish. “And
Pierre, too, he might have been happy enough with
his prayers and his painting had I but let him alone;
but it amused me to try my power—the Holy Virgin
forgive me!—and this is the end. Du Chesne told
me that I did not know the meaning of true love. I
have learned too late. Of what use is your perfection,
your credit at the court of heaven, your prayers
and virtues and mortifications, if you will not help
us? And I—I would rather be wicked and be able
to aid those I love, or at least to suffer with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a time after this impassioned outburst she lay
hushed in exhaustion, then a new thought aroused
her to action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is the mountain cross of M. de Maisonneuve;
it is said that great graces have been obtained
there. We must lose no time. They might be fighting
even now, and this may be the moment of greatest
danger.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Lydia, Lydia, awaken! We will go to pray at
the cross of M. de Maisonneuve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English girl lay sleeping with cheek upon her
hand, like an innocent babe. The perfect repose of
her position was so strangely childish and trustful
that it was hard to realize she was slumbering on
the brink of terror and desolation. The incongruity
impressed Diane forcibly, but as she knelt beside
the couch her face grew soft and womanly. When
she felt her friend’s hand laid gently on her shoulder,
Lydia started up with a faint cry, rubbing her eyes
and her soft flushed cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Diane, why have you awakened me? When I
am asleep I can at least forget,” she protested, sitting
up in bed, and staring at the demoiselle de Monesthrol
as if she were not sufficiently awake to realize
exactly what the scene meant. Diane’s expression of
restrained excitement recalled all; she flung herself
down on the pillows, and broke into violent sobbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something has happened, news has come; I see
by your face that it is evil tidings. The savages are
upon us, and even if they come here to scalp me, I am
too weak to move.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no news has come, Lydia, but rise and dress,”
was the crisp, laconic reply. “We will go to the
mountain cross to pray for du Chesne’s safety, I
have a conviction that at this moment he needs our
prayers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia’s blue eyes opened, wide and startled; in her
consternation she forgot to sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is dark night, still and lonely. The savages
may line every foot of the way; we may be
killed or taken prisoners. Oh! I dare not face the
dangers,” she cried, shuddering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The greater the merit of the pilgrimage. Our
sufferings may enable us to obtain grace; for danger,
I think nothing of it. Dress quickly and quietly; if
we are observed, we shall not be allowed to start”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Action was a relief from pain, and Diane was
bestirring herself vigorously. Finding herself being
hastily dressed, against her will, and perceiving that
her peevish importunities produced absolutely no
effect, Lydia ceased to resist. Indeed, this pale girl
with a troubled restlessness in her anxious eyes, a
pathetic droop of the red lips, moving with a steady
purpose, bore so little resemblance to vivid, brilliant
Diane, that the English girl was thoroughly frightened,
and became passive in the hands of the stronger
spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pilgrimage to the mountain cross was considered
at Ville Marie a fashionable act of devotion.
As the way to the mountain teemed with real and
tangible dangers, ladies generally undertook it in
parties, protected by armed escorts. Every tree or
stone might be expected to offer shelter to feathered
and painted enemies; there were also wild beasts to
be dreaded; so that in starting there was always the
possibility of not being able to return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the two girls—Diane erect and stately, never
for an instant pausing or faltering; Lydia clinging
feebly to her arm—like shadows moving amidst
shadows, were traversing the deserted streets. The
desolate, dark night was full of visionary terrors and
real dangers. The chant of the St. Lawrence filled
the air, the river trembling with violet tints and
glancing pearly shafts. Presently they crossed a
swiftly flowing stream, and emerged upon the open
country. Here no vagrant echo, not even the stir of
a leaf, disturbed the stillness. The dew was rich with
cool fragrance. Now dark trees would close up the
path, then it would widen into a world of space as
it passed into the odorous moorland or crossed little
rivulets tinkling on their way to the river. The
moonbeams, piercing through the interlacing branches,
threw chequered shadows on the path. Anon, amidst
vistas of leafy shade, they caught fleeting glimpses of
the illuminated world beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the two girls crept up the slope, under the
flickering shadows of the trees, the scene was incredibly
solitary and mournful. The path, simply an
Indian trail, was long and toilsome. Vegetation was
dense, tangled with vines, sombre with gloomy foliage,
through which the white light strove to penetrate.
Lydia, whose feelings were impressions which rarely
deepened into emotion, was rendered helplessly
hysterical by terror. All Diane’s faculties were absorbed
in a sombre, bewildering excitement, as with
the English captive sobbing, panting, clinging to her
arm, she made her way through the thicket. Before
long she was obliged to support the almost fainting
girl. Little did it matter what they endured, if their
sufferings might perchance gain the grace to save the
young Canadian from a cruel fate. Once the long
dewy trail of a creeper caught Diane lightly like the
grasp of a restraining hand; a soft rustle among the
leaves caused the heart to leap in her breast; that
long-drawn cry of a bird which broke the stillness in
melancholy cadences might be the signal of danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, gleaming white amidst dark, glossy foliage,
arose the cross erected on Mount Royal in a vow to
God for the conversion of the savages. Lydia, overcome
by fatigue, fear, the night air, the strain and
agitation of the expedition, now sank down against
a boulder. She had ceased to reason, and only
desired rest. The wooded gray slope towered immutably
above them, the wind harping in the pines.
The moon had dropped below the horizon, familiar
objects acquired strangely grotesque forms in the
uncertain light, while in the blue sky above trembled
a single luminous star. Pressing on, Diane knelt at
the foot of the cross. It seemed as though she had
at length reached a sure refuge, a power to whose
strength and goodness she could confidently appeal.
Then her hands clenched and her whole frame began
to shake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is for du Chesne, for his life, that we have
come so far to pray. He is so young and strong;
he might be so happy. Holy Virgin Mother, who
knowest the secret of all love and suffering, I ask
nothing for myself; let me suffer, but spare him.”
The sound of her voice seemed to profane the hush
of nature. Its tones had acquired a husky shrillness
in which there was a note of presaging horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are too holy, the saints—they despise
earthly pains and losses—they think only of their
own heavenly bliss—they set themselves against us.
Oh! how can they look calmly on our suffering?
God in heaven, have mercy! or is He also too high
and great to care for our poor, miserable concerns?
I will sacrifice myself—my life—what does anything
matter? If he returns in safety I make a vow to
enter the Congregation as a novice, to devote myself
to the expiation of my sins; only spare him, oh,
God!” Diane writhed and battled for air as a
paroxysm of suffocating sobs came upon her; then,
worn out with wild heart-broken weeping, she lay at
the foot of the cross, motionless and exhausted.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>A</span>S the girls crept wearily homeward, the first rays
of the summer dawn were breaking in the east
in flushes of saffron and pink; overhead the sky held
quivering lights, ready to flash into a blaze. A refreshing
sense of physical renewal was in the cool
blueness of the morning; there was dewy fragrance
in the atmosphere; the trees gave out a breath of
strength, the golden-rod gleamed in the hollows, the
heights were purple bronze. Lydia moved in a
state of passive exhaustion, half stupefied. As they
reached home Diane turned to her companion a face
which glowed with some subtle inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be assured that du Chesne is safe. God is good.
Oh, behold! that must be a messenger from M. du
Plessis, sent by M. de Callière. See how all the
people are gathering to hear what the tidings may
be. You are so exhausted, Lydia, it were perhaps
better to retire to your room. I see my uncle. I
will go to him; he will certainly know what has
occurred. If there is news I will return to you.”
An instant later she had joined Le Ber on the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there news of M. de Valrenne’s command?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, news has come at last. Oshawa has been
sent to say that they have caught sight of the enemy.
M. de Callière lies ill at La Prairie. M. de Valrenne
is stationed between there and Chambly.” Jacques Le
Ber showed no sign of weakness save a momentary
trembling of the lines about the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! my uncle, even to-night they may be with
us victorious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trader smiled. It would never do to admit
the possibility of disaster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sky may brighten for New France, my daughter.
I have ever remarked that good as well as ill-luck
runs in courses. Our good fortune may now
commence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of women, who had been attending the
early mass, were emerging from the church of Notre
Dame. Among them, erect and stately, walked
Madame de Monesthrol, attended by Nanon and followed
by Madame de St. Rochs with her baby in her
arms. Pierre, thin and dark and sallow, pushed his
way through the crowd to where the demoiselle de
Monesthrol stood a little apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Diane, I Have here for you a picture of Our Lady
of Pity surrounded by the five wounds of her Son.”
He tried to fortify himself by recalling the excellence
of his intention, but that only increased his nervous
agitation. “I have been holding a neuvena in honor
of St. Joseph and all the holy saints. For nine days,
a number especially dedicated to the holy angels,
have I prayed, and no light has dispersed the darkness
of my soul. Dazzling visions, the creation of
the Father of Evil, ever appear before my eyes.
Instead of the angelic faces which once beamed upon
me, it is thine I see, glorified by the crown of
martyrdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until now Diane had had slight patience with
Pierre’s freaks and fancies, considering them effeminate
and unreasonable. Now, looking at him with
wistful eyes, she said quietly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Pierre, we are all sorely tried by anxiety and
suspense. Try to forget your own temptations, my
cousin, in thought for others. Could you not support
my uncle, who is alone in this time of trouble?
On every hand you will find those who have need of
your kindly ministrations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the young man’s impatient gesture there appeared
all the petulance of misery. He felt it unreasonable
and monstrous that anything save the
painful state of his own concerns should occupy
Diane’s mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I stand alone,” he complained. “My father is
absorbed in worldly interests; your heart is engrossed
by vanity. What are the trivial affairs of this life—privation,
danger, and even death—in comparison
with the perils that menace the soul?”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The next day a terrible storm broke over Ville
Marie. Great trees groaned and snapped like
saplings in the blast, the wind raved, the whole
heavens were illumined by the swift electric flashes.
Such a storm had never been known in the colony.
Nature, in her convulsive throes smote the stoutest
heart with terror. Late in the afternoon the tempest
ceased. The sun set fair and beautiful, with rays of
purple and gold smiling on the waters of the river;
the clouds, black with the recoil of tempest, gradually
broke into rifts, trailing silvery tints of celestial hue,
sublime marvels of color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane joined Le Ber as he walked down to the shore.
That day no news had been received, yet it was almost
certain that an engagement had taken place.
His face was grey with consuming care; his eyes had
a famished expression. The demoiselle de Monesthrol
slipped her hand within the arm of her guardian
and walked quietly by his side, offering a mute responsive
sympathy which was grateful to his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall surely have news before night, my
daughter. Behold M. du Plessis on the shore; like
ourselves, he looks for tidings from our men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Restless expectation tinged everybody’s thoughts.
These were anxious moments to the French commander.
No one understood better than he the
reality of the danger that threatened the settlement.
His brow was heavy with care, though he endeavored
to seem at ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she looked out upon the shining waters of the
river, a strange perception came to Diane de Monesthrol.
It seemed as though the world had broken
into fragments and lay crumbling at her feet, while
her spirit soared free above the ruins. She already
understood the tragic possibilities of fear and loss
and pain; she had acknowledged the necessity of
devotion, self-abnegation, heroism; now a lightning
flash of intuition revealed to her the terrible beauty of
self-sacrifice, giving her to realize, though faintly and
indistinctly, some conception of a divine help, offered
with a human eagerness of sympathy, patient until
the feeble mortal hands could reach up and lay hold
of it. With this conviction a wonderful peace came
to succeed the burning wretchedness. Just then the
peals of the Angelus rang out, echoing through the
mountain slopes and over the waters. It was the
voice of prayer and praise, rising in triumph above all
earthly passions of grief and pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Groups of women, with heavy eyes and care-worn
faces, holding their rosaries with fingers which still
mechanically pressed the beads as they walked, while
their lips moved in silent prayer, came out from the
dusky seclusion of the church, where day and night
lights burned and prayers were offered. The beadle of
the Parish Church, in full uniform, mace in hand, was
narrating with much dramatic emphasis all the particulars
of a supposed engagement, to a keenly
interested group of listeners, when the tide of his
eloquence was abruptly checked by a sharp poke in
the ribs that deprived him of breath. Nanon, her
face flushed like a peony, the lappets of her cap
flying, swept past like a whirlwind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Seigneur dieu!</span> I would know the truth, me, after
waiting so long—a canoe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A boat arriving!—tidings!—tidings!” The words
passed from one to another, and were repeated in a
variety of keys, as, moved by a common impulse, the
group rapidly dispersed, flying down to the shore,
where the whole population of the town seemed to
have gathered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Propelled by four strong arms, skimming lightly as
foam over the surface of the water, leaving a faint
track behind it as it moved, the frail craft advanced.
As it came between the eager spectators and the sun,
the forms of those it contained stood out like silhouettes
against the light. The citizens of Ville Marie
waited with quickened breath and beating hearts,
hoping, fearing, expecting—they dared not think
what. Le Ber gazed with the wrinkles deepening on
his brow. The setting sun shone so brilliantly in his
eyes that he raised his hand to shade them; and for
the moment could see nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Le Canotier and Madouaska—the Blessed Virgin
send us good news,” du Plessis announced hurriedly,
speaking with a catch in his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then again a breathless silence settled on the
crowd; not a sound was heard but the dipping of the
paddles and the soft murmur of the waves as they
caressed the shore. Silently, swiftly the canoe advanced.
Beside the Canotier was an Indian, a tall,
superbly built man, whose remarkably regular features
might have been sculptured out of Florentine bronze.
Over his shoulders was thrown a mantle of caribou
skin with pink and lilac border. His head was
shaved, with the exception of a tuft on the crown,
which was ornamented with hawk feathers, resembling
the crest of an antique helmet. His face
was absolutely impassive in its immobility. As the
canoe grated on the shore, a dozen willing hands
offered aid in landing her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All is well?” cried du Plessis, unable longer to
restrain his anxiety. Then a shuddering, convulsive
sob ran through the ranks of the women as a French
officer appeared, bearing, in haggard eye and ghastly
pallor, traces of the fatal wound which was rapidly
draining his life-blood. Tender hands lifted him
from the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is M. le Capitaine de Breteuil. He is dying!”
The women separated to allow a lady, with three
little children clinging to her gown, to push her way
to the front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carry him home,” she said quietly. “At least the
good Lord has granted the favor of permitting him
to die with me. I must have courage; he will need
me beside him. Let us be together while we may.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant she had seemed on the point of
breaking into a wild outcry, but quickly checking the
impulse, had braced herself for the duty waiting her.
Now, as she spoke, the icy composure of voice and
manner seemed almost like indifference. A black-robed
nun silently detached herself from the crowd,
and placed herself at the side of the stricken wife.
Dollier de Casson, his brown earnest face all quivering
with emotion, solemnly raised his hands in
benediction over the living and the dying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not grudge the sacrifice, my daughter?
It is a hero willingly and gallantly laying down his
life for his faith and his King.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will be plenty of time to consider that
later,” she answered, very quietly. “Now he needs
me. I have no thought to spare for aught else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole assembly were hanging eagerly upon
the accents of le Canotier, who had already delivered
the despatches he had brought to M. du Plessis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We marched straight to Chambly—such were our
orders. The object of M. de Valrenne was to permit
those devils of English to pass, and then, by placing
himself in their rear, to cut them off from their
canoes. Our scouts—and there are none better than
Misti, Tshinespek and Mushawana,—soon discovered
the advance of the enemy, and then we marched six
or seven miles towards La Prairie, on the path by
which Schuyler was retreating. The sun stood high;
it was nine o’clock when our scouts met those of the
foe, and then—<span class='it'>Dianthe!</span>—the woods resounded with
the shrill yells of the Indians as their war-whoops
gave the alarm. You all know how that part of the
country is buried in forests. We take possession of a
ridge of ground that crosses the way of those English
wolves. Two enormous trees thrown down by the
storm have fallen along the crest of this rising ground,
and behind these we crouch in a triple row, well
hidden by bushes and thick standing stumps, like
wolves ready to spring upon their prey. Believe me,
Mesdames and Messieurs, I have witnessed much of
forest warfare, yet never before have I seen so hot a
conflict. The English charged like devils—(to give
them their due they do not lack courage)—and were
sent reeling back by a close and deadly volley. Like
hail the balls flew—three times were we mingled
together, scorching each other’s shirts by the flash
of our guns. With still greater fury our enemies
repeated the attack, and dislodged us from our place
of ambush. It was then the veritable struggle commenced.
Figure to yourself that they determined
to break through our lines, and our commandant
desired, above all else, to drive them back within the
reach of our people at La Prairie. Our muskets
thirsted to kill. There, amidst that storm of hell-fire,
stood M. de Valrenne, giving his orders, calm and
smiling as at a ball. Forty dead they left behind
them, those English, yet they managed to cut their
way through and drive us from the path.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the anxious listeners the prospect appeared to
grow darker and more appalling. There had been a
sharp engagement, many lives apparently had been
lost, and who could divine whose heart had been
smitten, whose home rendered desolate?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. le Lieutenant Dumerque?” asked a timorous
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead; shot at my side,” responded le Canotier,
with the sharp brevity of excitement. “I see a little
officer with hair as red as his coat, fighting like a
Turk. I send him a sugar plum—<span class='it'>v’là!</span>—his legs in
the air, but not before mon Lieutenant had fallen,
pierced by a shot from his hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a faint stifled cry. A pale young girl,
who had been listening eagerly, fell on the ground in
a nerveless heap; an elderly woman, with face set in
lines of stony composure, bent anxiously over her;
then Dollier de Casson, raising the slight form in his
strong arms, bore her away to her home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Mademoiselle Adèle de Montigny; they
were to have been married in the early days of September.
And his mother—it is the fourth son she
has lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed that those who listened to the vivid
recital could see the dim forests and floating smoke-wreaths,
with vague glimpses of the hidden foe.
They could imagine the incessant rattle of musketry,
could see terrible figures looming through the haze,
and watch the gleaming of the war-axes as the
weapons fell clattering from stricken hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cecile was clinging to Diane’s gown, trembling,
shivering, half believing herself already a
widow, the soft outlines and fresh bloom of youth
contrasting oddly with the pathetic trouble of her
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. de St. Rochs was safe, Madame, when I left.
I was sent away in charge of mon Capitaine before the
fight was fairly over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a little tempest, Madame de St. Rochs rushed
into Diane’s arms, sobbing, laughing, uttering inarticulate
exclamations of joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Le Ber’s grasp on his ward’s arm tightened. She
understood that he desired her to ask the question
which his own lips could not frame. Twice Diane
tried to speak, but her throat seemed to close each
time; the words would not come. It was Cecile who,
in a burst of joyful confidence, found voice for the
consuming desire of the French girl’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And M. Le Ber du Chesne—he is safe, of
course?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! yes, Madame, our brave young commandant.
And is it any wonder that the bluecoats love their
leader? He fought like all the king’s troops in one,
being of a valor truly marvellous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father caught his breath sharply and drew a hand
across his eyes, as if to clear his mind from confused
ideas. Diane had been watching the working of le
Canotier’s scarred and weather-beaten face with vigilant
scrutiny. The reaction, the sweetness of relief,
was almost as poignant a sensation as pain. For an
instant she closed her eyes and clung to Le Ber’s arm.
With what trembling thanksgiving she welcomed
this gleam of hope. The Blessed Virgin had granted
her prayer; the Holy Mother had a woman’s heart,
and was touched by compassion. Though du Chesne
would never be hers, yet he would live; his career, in
the brilliancy of its promise, would not be cut short;
he would continue to move in the light of God’s
earth; she would be spared the supreme anguish of
yielding him up to death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Absorbed in the interest of le Canotier’s narrative,
and in the incidents attending it, no one perceived
the rapid advance of another canoe. The shrill voice
of a child proclaimed the fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Voilà!</span> yet another canoe,” exclaimed one of the
group. “Truly, more news. It is M. le Chevalier
and the Sieur d’Ordieux—yes, and Baptiste Bras de
Fer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Le Ber, turning abruptly, withdrew his support.
Diane, gazing but not seeing, sickened with a sudden
sense of dread. She made a hasty step forward,
staggering like one blind, then, stretching her hands
with a long, gasping cry, that seemed to carry with it
the trouble of those last terrible days, recovered herself
by a supreme effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle, I have failed in my commission,
believe me, through no negligence or fault of mine.
I have brought back my brave and faithful comrade.
Do me the justice to believe that I would willingly
have given my own life in his stead.” It was the
Chevalier de Crisasi who spoke, the disorder of his
dress showing plainly the desperateness of the conflict
through which he had passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of this sudden panic, the downfall of
all her hopes, Diane had pity to spare for him who
felt so much. As he encountered her gaze he bowed
his head reverently. At that moment the girl’s secret
was revealed to him, and the Sicilian gentleman
stood awed and abashed before the revelation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was but now they said he was safe; it cannot
be du Chesne.” Le Ber’s shock was so great that he
looked piteously into his ward’s eyes as she stood with
her white lips pressed together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Diane’s agitation affected her strangely. She was
surprised at her own composure in this supreme
crisis. Hastily forming a distinct plan of action, she
coolly took command, directing everything. For the
first terrible interval she could not even wonder, or
doubt, or question. She seemed to have known it
all long ago, to have felt the cold creeping to her
heart to thrill her with a shiver as of ice, to have
grown used and deadened to it. It was du Chesne
who was being borne away helpless in Bras de Fer’s
strong arms, surrounded by anxious comrades and
kindred—du Chesne, whose eyes were pathetic with
the silent protest of life against death, whose bright,
boyish face wore that mysterious expression, sweeter,
calmer than a smile, that sometimes comes to those
who look their last upon life. She saw Cecile drop
down to the ground, heard Nanon’s noisy grief, was
conscious of the stricken look of Le Ber’s face, yet
she seemed to stand outside and beyond it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the hush and awe of natural sympathy, friends
and neighbors gathered around, looking with deep
pity on the bereavement which might so easily have
been their own. Ville Marie was overcast with
mourning for the fate of the kindly, genial young
fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one whom the young Canadian sought—his
wandering glances revealed the secret. All the
force within Diane was torn two ways, so sorely rent
as to scarcely leave her any strength for decisive
action. Her own affection, jealous, restless, imperative,
had claims which were irresistible. At such a
moment who would remember the helpless stranger’s
rights? Not Le Ber, who was absorbed in grief for
the destruction of his hopes; not Madame de Monesthrol,
who despised the English captive’s weakness;
nor Pierre, engrossed in his prayers and penances;
neither could it be Madame de St. Rochs, nor Nanon,
both of whom had conceived violent prejudices against
the intruder. During all the years of her after life
Diane could never think of the strength of that
dreadful temptation without a convulsion of her
whole being. She had no choice; the steadfast spirit,
holding brave sovereignty over the body and its
pangs, must triumph. Hearts, apparently, were made
to be crushed and broken. A little more or less,
what did it matter in the vast and silent anguish that
consumed her? In the heat of conflict there came
a new tide in her veins, a novel force to all her
thought. It was she who must break the news of
this bereavement to her rival, and she would be
required to comfort and sustain. It must be her part
to see that du Chesne’s desire was satisfied, that the
English girl should take her rightful place at her
lover’s death-bed. Every trace of color died out of
Lydia’s face as she listened; she turned on Diane a
wild and appealing look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is not true; it cannot be true. We were
to have been so happy together,” she insisted desperately,
sobbing out the words in her anguish and
terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one of those brilliant impulses of generosity,
courage and self-sacrifice which bear a noble soul on,
heedless of the temptations of the body, to the performance
of lofty deeds—acts of heroism in which life
goes for nothing—Diane supported the pretty, frightened
creature who clung to her panting and sobbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will come to him. You will try to be calm
for his sake,” the demoiselle de Monesthrol urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Lydia was overwhelmed with fear. The shock
rendered her helpless and hysterical; she wanted to
force her own complaints and grievances upon the
attention of others, rather than yield to the claims of
the dying man. She was utterly unable to collect
her scattered faculties. This frail sufferer, with spectral
eyes and pain-distorted form, seemed to have no
connection with her gay and gallant young lover.
She loved strength, brightness, the joy of life,
and hated anything that was maimed or gloomy.
She shuddered involuntarily as a feeling of repulsion
crept over her; she could not look at him without
whitening and shivering. She was not touched by
the spectacle of a valor so steadfast, a submission
so sweet; her one thought was to escape the horror
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Du Chesne lay in a quiet room, while the moments
which no human will could arrest swept on. He had
accepted the verdict passed upon him as the most
natural thing in the world—“quite simple,” as
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was still so young and ardent of temperament
that even the dark passage to the grave abounded
in hopeful portents. He would insist upon being
propped up in bed, and being allowed to talk. Affection
banished the solemn, wistful look from his face,
and gleamed like faint flashes of sunshine from the
edges of the dark shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Canadian was tender and considerate,
even on his death-bed. He was wondrously patient
in his pity for Lydia’s simplicity and weakness; his
dying eyes followed her ceaselessly, with a faithful
love which had been born on earth, but which would
last forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cecile, outside the door of the sick-room, cried out,
launching furious, vehement invectives against the
cruelty of Fate; and Nanon, all glowing red, her eyes
blazing with indignation, her lips quivering with genuine
distress, stood by, with a gaze of wrath and
disgust fixed on the stranger’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Lydia was too completely absorbed in her own
fright and misery to be sensible of criticism, animosity,
or even the evidences of tenderest affection.
All her complacent little vanities had vanished as,
clinging to her friend with piteous, shaking hands,
she sought vainly to obtain some inspiration from the
desperate bravery of Diane’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Diane, be good to her,” pleaded the dying man.
“You are her only protector. You are strong and
tender and loyal. I can trust you, my brave and
faithful sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the constancy of her courage Diane never either
faltered or failed. If she was crushed beneath the
cross which was laid upon her, she at least tasted the
supreme blessedness of sacrificing self. Tender affection
gave sight to her eyes, and taught her how to
comfort and solace the sufferer to beguile the pain
and tedium of a death-bed, to staunch those wounds
for which human art has no remedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A consciousness came over the household that sad
change and revolution hung over the family. Jean
Le Ber du Chesne was going away in the bloom of
his days to that unknown bourn of which God alone
knows the secret. It was very quiet in the death-chamber,
where the young hero lay looking at the
distant tapers, the one centre of light in the great
gloomy room, gazing with eyes from which all conflict
had departed, abstracted in their wistfulness.
He had grown calm in absolute self-surrender, giving
a sigh occasionally to what might have been, and
feeling perhaps an awakening thrill of anticipation of
what was to come. The room was filled with dusky,
wavering shadows. On a <span class='it'>prie-dieu</span> close at hand
knelt Diane. The torture of one who had fought
a protracted battle was ended by the hard-won victory
over self. In this solemn hour she felt the
stirring of some wider, grander life within, and the
human eyes gazed appealingly across the darkness
of present things, striving to see, no matter how indistinctly,
the first faint glimmer of that light which
glows beyond the grave. Farther from the bed, two
nuns of the Congregation, Sister Marguerite Bourgeois,
an aged woman whose serenity of countenance
was like a benediction, and sister Berbier, Superior
of the Convent of the Congregation, whispered together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something stirred softly. At the sound of the
measured, ill-assured movements, timid yet rushing,
with a definite purpose underlying the desperate haste,
even Diane raised her head, and the nuns, crossing
themselves, drew closer together. A wan, hollow-eyed
form, gliding from among the shadows, advanced
towards the bed, stood for a moment gazing
down upon du Chesne’s peaceful face, and then disappeared
as noiselessly as it had entered. The
strong and subtle tie of kindred had drawn Jeanne
Le Ber from the seclusion of years. The spectators
were awed by the sight of a mortal, divided from all
human hopes and interests, yet still firmly bound to
its inheritance of human woe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Night had passed. The stars paled in the sky,
lingering shadows dispersed, the dawn was breaking
in the east. Sister Berbier rose, and crossing the
room, threw open the heavy wooden shutters. The
fresh, cool air, moist and odorous, rushed in; and with
it a searching ray of light, clear and terrible, fell upon
the calm dead face on the pillow.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXVII.</h1></div>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:.9em;'><span class='it'>A COMPLETED SACRIFICE.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>“M</span>Y daughter, when the earthly hope that lights
existence has faded, and we find it impossible
to lay down our lives to perish in the grave
beside it—when we can neither endure our trouble
nor be reconciled to it—we can only disengage ourselves
and leave it behind us, dead and buried. The
true and genuine portion of our sorrow lives; the
base regrets we must learn to cast from us; there is
no companionship between the living and the dead,”
Dollier de Casson assured Diane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All had come to an abrupt and ruthless end; the
anxiety and suspense had terminated in dread certainty.
Hope and fear had perished with du Chesne,
yet the tense throb of anguish survived. The girl
was crushed under the cross which had been laid
upon her, and which she did not know how to bear.
Pleasure and hope had broken off short; existence
was a solitude. Often it struck her as strange that
no one had ever suspected that she, as well as the
gallant young Canadian, had died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lydia’s forlorn condition attracted much sympathy;
the sentimental appreciation of a dramatic
situation, so dear to the French heart, operated in her
favor. She enjoyed posing as a victim of affliction,
and performed the role so modestly and gracefully
that she won all hearts. Du Chesne to her would
remain a tender, pensive memory, which throughout
her life would be capable of affording occupation for
an idle hour, comfort for a distressed one, and which
would not forbid consolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two years later, the Sieur d’Ordieux, by the death
of his uncle, became Duke de Ronceval, and triumphed
over his enemies. Though he had entered
upon a great inheritance, and become a peer of
France, the pompous little man was faithful in his
attachments. He did not forget those who had
befriended him in the day of adversity; his heart
remained true to the woman whom he had loved
with all the devotion of which he was capable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The future of her niece had furnished the consuming
anxiety of Madame de Monesthrols existence.
If her protector Le Ber should die, what
would become of the beautiful portionless girl? If
Diane only had a vocation, that would simplify
matters; she might become a nun, and a safe retreat
would be secured from the perils of the world. But
Diane had no vocation, and the Duke de Ronceval’s
affection offered a solution of the difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When an advantageous settlement was in question,
it was not the custom in those days to consult the
bride’s taste. The sacrifice of the individual for the
good of the race was then—as it still to a large extent
remains—a generally accepted principle among the
French. A well-bred damsel, trained in the traditions
of the ancient <span class='it'>régime</span>, would make it a point
of honor to accept the fate which her family chose
for her, just as a high-spirited girl of our generation
would take a pride in rendering herself independent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Youth and hope had perished, but the claims of
duty remained imperative; so when Madame de
Monesthrol urged, “By marrying the Duke you will
not only secure a great establishment for yourself;
you will also purchase peace for me. When I know
that you are provided for, I can spend my last days
in repose. I have suffered, my child, you will never
know how much”—Diane could not turn a deaf ear
to the prayer of the kinswoman who loved her well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The annual ship was returning to France, an event
always of the deepest importance to the whole
colony. Every man, woman, and child who could
manage to get to the water-side at Quebec, gathered
to view the departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most prominent passengers were the Duke
and Duchess de Ronceval. Curled, powdered and
decorated, the nobleman stormed at his obsequious
lackeys, or gesticulated wildly as he jested with his
friends. The pale, beautiful bride was composed and
dignified. Madame de Monesthrol remarked with
satisfaction that her niece bore herself with an air of
the very highest distinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little desolate group had gathered about Diane.
This parting meant the sundering forever of ties
which had been very close and dear. Jacques Le
Ber was there. He had aged, and the stern lines of
his face were visibly deepened. Madame de Monesthrol,
older, frailer, always bearing her infirmities
with suave dignity, leaned upon his arm. Nanon,
her comely honest face disfigured by the tears which
she made no effort to restrain, pressed close to her
mistress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sunshine of my life goes with thee.” Le Ber
spoke in a low, moved voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is your desire that I should serve your interests
at the Court, my uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My little one, could I but accompany thee!”
Then the Marquise added brightly, “Though the
journey is beyond my strength, I can always pray
for thy welfare. I can think of thee as occupying
thy rightful place in the world, and I can praise the
good God that the desire of my heart has been
realized. Thy marriage has removed the last trace
of anxiety from my mind; I can await my end in
peace. Thy duty lies before thee, my daughter.
Let no remembrance of a feeble old woman, whose
stormy life is ending in a haven of rest, weaken thy
peace. Think of me always as rejoicing in thy
prosperity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the good ship <span class='it'>Renommée</span> disappeared below the
horizon, Nanon lifted up her voice and wept with
boisterous vehemence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I looked my last look upon my demoiselle
her face was like that of an angel. Never shall I see
the like again. My little one, that I cradled in my
arms, and who loved me with her whole heart. I am
but of the people—if my heart is broken I have no
need to look like a stone; now that she has left me I
shall please myself by weeping like a waterspout.
She said to me, speaking, oh! so gently, at the very
last, ‘It is thy duty to stay with Madame, to comfort
and care for her, as it is mine to leave her. Neither
of us must forget her obligations, we will both strive
to fulfil them nobly and faithfully, good and loving
Nanon.’ Oh! my brave and beautiful demoiselle, I
coveted greatness for her, I wanted to see her set high
above all the world, and behold! Her Grace Madame
la Duchess de Ronceval is taken away from my
sight. It sounds well, that title, even if my heart is
broken. How can I live without her? what can the
blessed saints be thinking of up in heaven there?
Behold that blonde English sheep, selfish and cold-blooded
as a snake, the happy wife of M. de Gallifet,
no less! No one will ever cry her eyes out for her.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>At the Court of Louis the Magnificent, Diane de
Ronceval lived out the years that remained to her.
The vivifying breath of an utterly unselfish affection
had touched her. All egotism had been annihilated
by the fierce sweep of a spiritual flame, before which
every unworthy desire and ambition had perished.
In the midst of a corrupt society, she preserved a
noble and lofty ideal. With an earnest and simple
contriving of gentle charities, she strove to make
some rough places smooth. Brave with the inspiration
of faith and hope, she found happiness in identifying
herself with the needs and claims of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If she were conscious of a wound which throbbed
and bled, of unquenchable longings, of memories
which never were to be forgotten, she contrived to
carry her cross in such fashion that no other heart
should be saddened, no other’s joy shadowed. And
the world was purer and brighter for one woman’s
faith and courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A volume of great literary and historical value, and one of deep national
interest.”—<span class='it'>St. Thomas Times.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“This book is capital reading, and throws some unexpected lights on a comedy
that had its tragic features.”—<span class='it'>Montreal Gazette.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“The book gives us a better idea of the condition of Canadian society when the
Queen came to the throne than perhaps any history of the time does.”—<span class='sc'>Rev.
Principal Grant</span>, in <span class='it'>Toronto Globe</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The reader finds many amusing pages illustrative of the primitive ideas of the
people, nor are tales of cruelty and outrage wanting to make up the grimmer side
of the picture.”—<span class='it'>Detroit Free Press.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“The authors are of French extraction, and come honestly by the epigrammatic
style, which their former work familiarized us with, and which renders the
opening chapter of this volume brilliant.”—<span class='it'>Montreal Witness.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“The authors know their subject—their style of writing is conspicuously
sprightly, full of wit, which is at times truly caustic. It is an admirable supplement
to existing histories and journals and memoirs on the subject”—<span class='it'>Buffalo
Illustrated Express.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“An intensely interesting book, a true and vivid picture of that confused
period. If the overabundance of material has been a drawback, on the other hand
it has given a style, a nervous energy and strength, and a dash that are
refreshing.”—<span class='it'>Mail and Empire.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“The principal value of the book to most readers will be in the power which
these pages possess of bringing the student face to face with the incidents of the
epoch to which they refer, and its interest is enhanced by the manner in which
toe story is told, different in various respects from that of the ordinary scribe—the
style of well-bred and accomplished women, entirely free from affectation and
effort.”—<span class='sc'>Prof. Wm. Clark</span>, in <span class='it'>Montreal Star</span>.</p>
